Essentia natural memory foam is not· as temperature sensitive. Move

As you can see from the review grid above, Essentia outperforms

Essentia is the only mattress company aside from Tempur-Pedic
to manufacture their own memory foam. Other mattress brands
purchase foam from conventional foam manufacturers.
No-Name Brand Comparison
;·,~attress
There are very few memory foam manufacturers In North America.
Some include Tempur-Pedlc, Carpenter, Foam~x. and Essentia.
Some are European and most are Chinese.
"Me Too" memory foam mattress retailers may buy from different
suppliers but It all derives from the same manufacturers.
Since most memory foams are dose to ideutical, retailers
distinguish themselves with price, reviews, marketing verbiage all
the-while piggybacking on the Tempurpedlc brand. Ask any
memory foam mattress company to answer the questions in our
nrid above and they'll fall short as well.

eco memory foam mattresses. They'll call them BiOH foams, planr

Health Issues with Memory Foam Mattresses
The toxicity ot memory foam mattresses have real health
implications. Memory foam mattresses tested emitted VOC's, up to
61 toxic chemicals, including the carcinogen's benzene and
naphthalene. Headaches, migraines, feeling sick, nausea, and
difficulty breathing are common reactions from inhaling the fumes
of chemically derived memory foam mattresses. So

Sleeping In the wrong position every night affects your

Our medical support mattresses are engineered for superior spinal

Essentla mattresses are easily among the best memory foam
mattresses on the market.
DurabiOty
How long should a mattress be comfortably sup~rtive? 20 years+
-Spring mattresses lose 16% of their support in the 1st year.
- Merraory foam mattresses are similar to couch foam when it comes
to durability. Some lose support rather qurckly, others feel good for
years.
- latex foam mattresses can last almost as long as Essentia
mattresses depending on their quality.

Tox9c
Non ~
Mattresses are surprisingly unhealthy. Not ours.
Most mattresses are made with toxic foams, glues, chemically
treated fabrics and are a breeding ground for dust mites and other
allergens.
Essentla mattresses are made from a slew of natural ingredients
designed to keep your sleep healthy.
Essentla Natural Memory Foam
Breathablllty Is a common and major complaint among memory
foam mattress owners. This is because even the best memory foam
mattresses on the market are synthetic and made from
petrochemicals. Essentia developed a · .1tll·· n· ~rn,, . whkh is
80% more breathable. By replacing the petrochemicals with natural
ingredients such as ni1tur.lllutlAX. P~"'tAnt•al 011\, plant extracts and
water we've created a healthy alterr.ative to petroleum based
synthetic mernory foam mattresses.
Benefits of our Natural Memory Foam
a) 80% better breathability.
Result: Breathes Hke cotton, not polyester. No
trapped heat. You won't get hot and sticky.
b) A foam that has no chemical odor and is frt'~
or han11f!JI_V O~'"· (off-gassing)
~~sentia 000018

Off-gassing causes eye irritation, skin irritation, headaches and
migraines.
Off-gassing is recognized as harmful by health care institutions for
patients with respiratory problems - why should they be offered to
healthy people? Read more about h ~m· 1!; 111 m.tttf'~;. . ,,;~.
c) A product than doesn't pollute during manufacturing.
Over 1 million tons of toxic chemicals leach Into the environment
annually by petrochemical based memory foams and glues.
Our employees don't need protective gear and henefit from a safe
work environment.
Exclusive Molding Technology
All mattresses are composed of layers. Both spring and memory
foam mattresses are composed of layers. Some Essentia models
such as ourB. . ~v~t""JmmflJ and Qor.n,eust- use our patented molding
technology. Molding them together creates a permanent bond
and ex~~lonat ;.\llrl 'HllftLH~ con:tforr ~.>o.latnP.d b~r(l, All our other
mattresses contain completely safe and non-toxic VOC free natural
liquid latex and acrylic resin adhesive.
Facts:
- Most adhesives used in mattress manufacturing emit toxic fumes
for the first 2- 3 years.
- Fumes from some adhesives cause cancer according to the IRTA.
(Institute for Research and Technical Assistance)
- We Inhale these fumes for 8 hours per night 365 days per year.
