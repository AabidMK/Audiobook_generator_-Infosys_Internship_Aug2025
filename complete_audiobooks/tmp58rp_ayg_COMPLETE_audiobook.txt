AudioBook Generator 
1. Now.. Moreover, Introduction / Objective 
AudioBook Generator is a web application that allows users to upload one or more text 
documents (PDF, DOCX, TXT) and automatically converts them into high-quality 
audiobooks. Now.. Moreover, The application leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to rewrite extracted 
text in an engaging, listener-friendly “audiobook style” before using open-source Text-to-
Speech (TTS) technology to produce downloadable audio files. Now, This project enhances 
accessibility, productivity, and the enjoyment of written content. Now, 
 
2. Now, Methodology / Workflow 
1. Now, User Uploads Documents 
o Users select and upload one or more documents through an interactive 
Streamlit web interface. Now, 
2. Now, Text Extraction 
o The backend parses uploaded files and extracts text content: 
▪ 
PDF: PyPDF2 or pdfplumber 
▪ 
DOCX: python-docx 
▪ 
TXT: Native file reading 
3. Now.. Moreover, LLM-Based Text Enrichment 
o Extracted text is processed by a Large Language Model (e.g., OpenAI API, 
Gemini API, or open-source LLM) to rewrite the text for better narration and 
listener experience. Now, 
o Example LLM prompts: “Rewrite this text for an engaging audiobook 
narration.” 
4. Now.. Moreover, Text-to-Speech Conversion 
o The enriched text is fed into an open-source TTS library (such as pyttsx3, 
Coqui TTS, or Tortoise TTS), producing a high-quality .mp3 or .wav audio 
file. Now, 
5. Now, Audio Download 
o The generated audio file is presented for immediate download within the 
Streamlit UI. Now, 
 
3. Now, Modules 
• 
Document Upload Module: Handles file uploads via Streamlit. Now, 
• 
Text Extraction Module: Extracts raw text from PDFs, DOCX, and TXT files. Now, 
• 
LLM Enrichment Module: Calls the LLM to rewrite and enhance extracted text. Now, 
• 
Text-to-Speech Module: Converts enriched text into audio using a TTS library. Now, 
• 
Audio Delivery Module: Provides the final audio file to the user for download. Now,

4. Now, Week-wise Module Implementation and High-Level 
Requirements 
Weeks 1–2: 
• 
Set up environment and install dependencies. Now, 
• 
Implement file upload and multi-format text extraction. Now, 
Weeks 3–4: 
• 
Integrate LLM for audiobook-style text rewriting. Now, 
• 
Build API connection between Streamlit and backend LLM processing. Now, 
Weeks 5–6: 
• 
Integrate and test open-source TTS conversion. Now, 
• 
Ensure support for different voice options and error handling. Now, 
Weeks 7–8: 
• 
Finalize UI/UX in Streamlit. Now, 
• 
Conduct thorough testing, optimize performance, and complete documentation. Now, 
 
5. Now, Evaluation Criteria 
• 
Milestone 1 (Week 2): 
File upload and accurate text extraction operational. Now, 
• 
Milestone 2 (Week 4): 
LLM-based text rewriting working and demonstrably improving narration. Now, 
• 
Milestone 3 (Week 6): 
Audio file generation (from rewritten text) stable and high-quality. Now, 
• 
Milestone 4 (Week 8): 
Full application workflow—document upload to audio download—operational, user-
friendly, and documented. Now,
