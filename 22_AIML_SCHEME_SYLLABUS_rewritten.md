## Java Programming

**2. Calculator and Sorting:**

Let's dive into some fundamental Java programming. First, we'll build a simple calculator program.  Then, we'll tackle a slightly more challenging task: sorting a list of elements using the bubble sort algorithm.  This will give you a solid foundation in Java's capabilities.

**3. Student Object Creation:**

Next, we'll create a `Student` class. This class will store information like USN (University Seat Number), Name, Branch, and Phone number for each student.  We'll then write a program to create multiple `Student` objects and neatly display their details, with appropriate headings for easy readability.

**4.  Method Overloading and Abstract Classes:**

Now for some object-oriented programming concepts. We’ll create a class with instance methods and demonstrate method overloading – using the same method name but with different parameters. This is a powerful tool for creating flexible and reusable code. Then, we'll explore the use of abstract classes to calculate areas of different shapes, a common example in object-oriented design.

**5. Staff Inheritance:**

We'll design a `Staff` superclass containing details like Staff ID, Name, Phone, and Salary. From this, we’ll create three subclasses: `Teaching` (with domain and publications), `Technical` (with skills), and `Contract` (with contract period).  Finally, we’ll write a program to create and display staff objects representing each category.


**6. Customer Data and String Tokenizer:**

Let's work with strings and data manipulation.  We'll build a `Customer` class to store customer names and dates of birth (in dd/mm/yyyy format).  The program will read customer data using a comma as a delimiter, and then neatly display the data, separating the day, month, and year elements using the `String Tokenizer` class.

**7. Multi-threaded Application:**

This exercise explores Java's multi-threading capabilities. We'll create a program with three threads: one generates a random integer every second, the second computes the square, and the third computes the cube, and each thread prints its result.  This demonstrates concurrent programming in Java.

**8. File Character, Line, and Word Count:**

Here, we'll create a program to analyze a text file. It will count and display the number of characters, lines, and words within the file.


**9. File Display with Line Numbers:**

Building on the previous exercise, this program will read a file, display its content on the screen, and also add line numbers to each line, making it easier to reference specific parts of the file.

**10. GUI Calculator:**

Finally, let's build a more advanced calculator with a graphical user interface (GUI). This calculator uses a grid layout to arrange the digit buttons and operation buttons (+, -, *, %), and includes a text field to display the calculated result.  Crucially, we will also include error handling to prevent issues like division by zero.

Each session will include lectures, digital presentations, video demonstrations, quizzes, and student-led summaries.


**Module 2: Image Processing (10 Hours)**

Now we'll delve into image processing techniques to manipulate and analyze images.  We'll cover:

* Image transforms – changing the representation of an image for easier processing.
* Image enhancement – making images clearer and more detailed.
* Image filtering – removing noise and sharpening edges.
* Color image processing – working with the rich information in color images.
* Image segmentation – dividing an image into meaningful regions.

Then, we move to the crucial topic of image descriptors and features:  how computers extract meaningful information from images.  We’ll explore:

* Texture descriptors – analyzing surface patterns.
* Color features – using color information for object recognition.
* Edges/boundaries – identifying shapes and objects based on their outlines.
* Object boundary and shape representations – describing shapes mathematically.
* Interest/corner point detectors – identifying key points within an image.
* Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) – a powerful feature descriptor for object detection.
* Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) – robust features that remain consistent across different scales.
* Speeded-Up Robust Features (SURF) – a faster alternative to SIFT.
* Saliency – identifying the most important parts of an image.

Again, the learning style will be a mix of lectures, presentations, demos, quizzes, and student-led session recaps.


**Module 3: Machine Learning and Applications (10 Hours)**

This module connects computer vision with the power of machine learning. We'll look at:

* Fundamentals of Machine Learning:  We’ll start with linear regression, decision functions, statistical decision theory, parameter estimation, clustering, dimensionality reduction, and linear discriminant analysis. These are the building blocks for intelligent image analysis.
* Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs): We'll examine their application in pattern classification.
* Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):  These specialized networks are the backbone of modern computer vision.
* Autoencoders –  networks used for feature extraction and dimensionality reduction.

Finally, we’ll put it all together, exploring real-world applications of computer vision, including:

* Gesture recognition – allowing computers to understand human gestures.
* Motion estimation and object tracking – following objects as they move.
* Programming assignments – you'll have the chance to apply your new skills to practical problems.

The teaching methods remain consistent throughout the course.
