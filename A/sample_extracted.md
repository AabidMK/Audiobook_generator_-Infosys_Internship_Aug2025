Practical Vedanta 
Part – 1 
(Delivered in London, 10th November 1896) 
 
I have been asked to say something about the practical position 
of the Vedanta philosophy. As I have told you, theory is very 
good indeed, but how are we to carry it into practice? If it be 
absolutely impracticable, no theory is of any value whatever, 
except as intellectual gymnastics. The Vedanta, therefore, as a 
religion must be intensely practical. We must be able to carry it 
out in every part of our lives. And not only this, the fictitious 
differentiation between religion and the life of the world must 
vanish, for the Vedanta teaches oneness — one life throughout. 
 
The ideals of religion must cover the whole field of life, they must 
enter into all our thoughts, and more and more into practice. I will 
enter gradually on the practical side as we proceed. But this series 
of lectures is intended to be a basis, and so we must first apply 
ourselves to theories and understand how they are worked out, 
proceeding from forest caves to busy streets and cities; and one 
peculiar feature we find is that many of these thoughts have been 
the outcome, not of retirement into forests, but have emanated from 
persons whom we expect to lead the busiest lives — from ruling 
monarchs.

Shvetaketu was the son of Âruni, a sage, most probably a 
recluse. He was brought up in the forest, but he went to the city 
of the Panchâlas and appeared at the court of the king, 
Pravâhana Jaivali. The king asked him, "Do you know how 
beings depart hence at death?" "No, sir." "Do you know how 
they return hither?" "No, sir." "Do you know the way of the 
fathers and the way of the gods?" "No, sir." Then the king asked 
other questions. Shvetaketu could not answer them. So the king 
told him that he knew nothing. The boy went back to his father, 
and the father admitted that he himself could not answer these 
questions. It was not that he was unwilling to answer these 
questions. It was not that he was unwilling to teach the boy, but 
he did not know these things. So he went to the king and asked 
to be taught these secrets. The king said that these things had 
been hitherto known only among kings; the priests never knew 
them.  
 
He, however, proceeded to teach him what he desired to know. 
In various Upanishads we find that this Vedanta philosophy is 
not the outcome of meditation in the forests only, but that the 
very best parts of it were thought out and expressed by brains 
which were busiest in the everyday affairs of life. We cannot 
conceive any man busier than an absolute monarch, a man who 
is ruling over millions of people, and yet, some of these rulers 
were deep thinkers.

Everything goes to show that this philosophy must be very 
practical; and later on, when we come to the Bhagavad-Gita — 
most of you, perhaps, have read it, it is the best commentary we 
have on the Vedanta philosophy — curiously enough the scene 
is laid on the battlefield, where Krishna teaches this philosophy 
to Arjuna; and the doctrine which stands out luminously in 
every page of the Gita is intense activity, but in the midst of it, 
eternal calmness. This is the secret of work, to attain which is 
the goal of the Vedanta. Inactivity, as we understand it in the 
sense of passivity, certainly cannot be the goal. Were it so, then 
the walls around us would be the most intelligent; they are 
inactive. Clods of earth, stumps of trees, would be the greatest 
sages in the world; they are inactive. Nor does inactivity become 
activity when it is combined with passion. 
 
Real activity, which is the goal of Vedanta, is combined with 
eternal calmness, the calmness which cannot be ruffled, the 
balance of mind which is never disturbed, whatever happens. 
And we all know from our experience in life that that is the best 
attitude for work. I have been asked many times how we can 
work if we do not have the passion which we generally feel for 
work. I also thought in that way years ago, but as I am growing 
older, getting more experience, I find it is not true. The less 
passion there is, the better we work. The calmer we are, the 
better for us, and the more the amount of work we can do. When 
we let loose our feelings, we waste so much energy, shatter our 
nerves, disturb our minds, and accomplish very little work. The 
energy which ought to have gone out as work is spent as mere 


 
 
6 
 
feeling, which counts for nothing. It is only when the mind is very 
calm and collected that the whole of its energy is spent in doing 
good work. 
 
And if you read the lives of the great workers which the world 
has produced, you will find that they were wonderfully calm 
men. Nothing, as it were, could throw them off their balance. 
That is why the man who becomes angry never does a great 
amount of work, and the man whom nothing can make angry 
accomplishes so much. The man who gives way to anger, or 
hatred, or any other passion, cannot work; he only breaks 
himself to pieces, and does nothing practical. It is the calm, 
forgiving, equable, well-balanced mind that does the greatest 
amount of work. The Vedanta preaches the ideal; and the ideal, 
as we know, is always far ahead of the real, of the practical, as 
we may call it. There are two tendencies in human nature: one 
to harmonise the ideal with the life, and the other to elevate the 
life to the ideal. 
 
It is a great thing to understand this, for the former tendency is 
the temptation of our lives. I think that I can only do a certain 
class of work. Most of it, perhaps, is bad; most of it, perhaps, 
has a motive power of passion behind it, anger, or greed, or 
selfishness. Now if any man comes to preach to me a certain 
ideal, the first step towards which is to give up selfishness, to 
give up self-enjoyment, I think that is impractical. But when a 
man brings an ideal which can be reconciled with my 
selfishness, I am glad at once and jump at it.That is the ideal for 


 
 
7 
 
me. As the word "orthodox" has been manipulated into various 
forms, so has been the word "practical". "My doxy is orthodoxy; 
your doxy is heterodoxy." So with practicality. What I think is 
practical, is to me the only practicality in the world. 
 
If I am a shopkeeper, I think shopkeeping the only practical 
pursuit in the world. If I am a thief, I think stealing is the best 
means of being practical; others are not practical. You see how 
we all use this word practical for things we like and can do. 
Therefore I will ask you to understand that Vedanta, though it is 
intensely practical, is always so in the sense of the ideal. It does 
not preach an impossible ideal, however high it be, and it is high 
enough for an ideal. In one word, this ideal is that you are divine, 
"Thou art That". This is the essence of Vedanta; after all its 
ramifications and intellectual gymnastics, you know the human 
soul to be pure and omniscient, you see that such superstitions 
as birth and death would be entire nonsense when spoken of in 
connection with the soul. The soul was never born and will never 
die, and all these ideas that we are going to die and are afraid to 
die are mere superstitions. And all such ideas as that we can do 
this or cannot do that are superstitions. We can do everything. 
 
The Vedanta teaches men to have faith in themselves first. As 
certain religions of the world say that a man who does not 
believe in a Personal God outside of himself is an atheist, so the 
Vedanta says, a man who does not believe in himself is an 
atheist. Not believing in the glory of our own soul is what the 
Vedanta calls atheism. To many this is, no doubt, a terrible idea; 


 
 
8 
 
and most of us think that this ideal can never be reached; but the 
Vedanta insists that it can be realised by every one.There is 
neither man nor woman or child, nor difference of race or sex, 
nor anything that stands as a bar to the realisation of the ideal, 
because Vedanta shows that it is realised already, it is already 
there. 
 
All the powers in the universe are already ours. It is we who have 
put our hands before our eyes and cry that it is dark. 
Know that there is no darkness around us. Take the hands away 
and there is the light which was from the beginning. Darkness 
never existed, weakness never existed. We who are fools cry that 
we are weak; we who are fools cry that we are impure. Thus 
Vedanta not only insists that the ideal is practical, but that it has 
been so all the time; and this Ideal, this Reality, is our own 
nature. Everything else that you see is false, untrue. As soon as 
you say, "I am a little mortal being," you are saying something 
which is not true, you are giving the lie to yourselves, you are 
hypnotising yourselves into something vile and weak and 
wretched. The Vedanta recognises no sin, it only recognises 
error. And the greatest error, says the Vedanta, is to say that you 
are weak, that you are a sinner, a miserable creature, and that 
you have no power and you cannot do this and that. Every time 
you think in that way, you, as it were, rivet one more link in the 
chain that binds you down, you add one more layer of hypnotism 
on to your own soul. Therefore, whosoever thinks he is weak is 
wrong, whosoever thinks he is impure is wrong, and is throwing 
a bad thought into the world.This we must always bear in mind 


 
 
9 
 
that in the Vedanta there is no attempt at reconciling the present 
life — the hypnotised life, this false life which we have assumed 
— with the ideal; but this false life must go, and the real life 
which is always existing must manifest itself, must shine out. No 
man becomes purer and purer, it is a matter of greater 
manifestation. 
 
The veil drops away, and the native purity of the soul begins to 
manifest itself. Everything is ours already — infinite purity, 
freedom, love, and power. The Vedanta also says that not only 
can this be realised in the depths of forests or caves, but by men 
in all possible conditions of life. We have seen that the people 
who discovered these truths were neither living in caves nor 
forests, nor following the ordinary vocations of life, but men 
who, we have every reason to believe, led the busiest of lives, 
men who had to command armies, to sit on thrones, and look to 
the welfare of millions — and all these, in the days of absolute 
monarchy, and not as in these days when a king is to a great 
extent a mere figurehead. Yet they could find time to think out 
all these thoughts, to realise them, and to teach them to 
humanity. How much more then should it be practical for us 
whose lives, compared with theirs, are lives of leisure? That we 
cannot realise them is a shame to us, seeing that we are 
comparatively free all the time, having very little to do. My 
requirements are as nothing compared with those of an ancient 
absolute monarch. My wants are as nothing compared with the 
demands of Arjuna on the battlefield of Kurukshetra, 
commanding a huge army; and yet he could find time in the 


 
 
10 
 
midst of the din and turmoil of battle to talk the highest 
philosophy and to carry it into his life also. Surely we ought to 
be able to do as much in this life of ours — comparatively free, 
easy, and comfortable. 
 
Most of us here have more time than we think we have, if we 
really want to use it for good. With the amount of freedom we 
have we can attain to two hundred ideals in this life, if we will, 
but we must not degrade the ideal to the actual. One of the most 
insinuating things comes to us in the shape of persons who 
apologise for our mistakes and teach us how to make special 
excuses for all our foolish wants and foolish desires;and we 
think that their ideal is the only ideal we need have. But it is not 
so. The Vedanta teaches no such thing. 
 
The actual should be reconciled to the ideal, the present life 
should be made to coincide with life eternal. For you must 
always remember that the one central ideal of Vedanta is this 
oneness. There are no two in anything, no two lives, nor even 
two different kinds of life for the two worlds. You will find the 
Vedas speaking of heavens and things like that at first; but later 
on, when they come to the highest ideals of their philosophy, 
they brush away all these things. There is but one life, one 
world, one existence. Everything is that One, the difference is 
in degree and not in kind. The difference between our lives is 
not in kind. The Vedanta entirely denies such ideas as that 
animals are separate from men, and that they were made and 
created by God to be used for our food. Some people have been 


 
 
11 
 
kind enough to start an antivivisection society. I asked a 
member, "Why do you think, my friend, that it is quite lawful to 
kill animals for food, and not to kill one or two for scientific 
experiments?" He replied, "Vivisection is most horrible, but 
animals have been given to us for food." Oneness includes all 
animals. If man's life is immortal, so also is the animal's. 
 
The difference is only in degree and not in kind. The amoeba 
and I are the same, the difference is only in degree; and from the 
standpoint of the highest life, all these differences vanish. A 
man may see a great deal of difference between grass and a little 
tree, but if you mount very high, the grass and the biggest tree 
will appear much the same. So, from the standpoint of the 
highest ideal, the lowest animal and the highest man are the 
same. If you believe there is a God, the animals and the highest 
creatures must be the same. A God who is partial to his children 
called men, and cruel to his children called brute beasts, is worse 
than a demon. I would rather die a hundred times than worship 
such a God. My whole life would be a fight with such a God. 
But there is no difference, and those who say there is, are 
irresponsible, heartless people who do not know. Here is a case 
of the word practical used in a wrong sense. I myself may not 
be a very strict vegetarian, but I understand the ideal. 
 
When I eat meat I know it is wrong. Even if I am bound to eat it 
under certain circumstances, I know it is cruel. I must not drag 
my ideal down to the actual and apologise for my weak conduct 
in this way. The ideal is not to eat flesh, not to injure any being, 


 
 
12 
 
for all animals are my brothers. If you can think of them as your 
brothers, you have made a little headway towards the 
brotherhood of all souls, not to speak of the brotherhood of 
man! That is child's play. You generally find that this is not very 
acceptable to many, because it teaches them to give up the 
actual, and go higher up to the ideal. But if you bring out a 
theory which is reconciled with their present conduct, they 
regard it as entirely practical.  
 
There is this strongly conservative tendency in human nature: 
we do not like to move one step forward. I think of mankind 
just as I read of persons who become frozen in snow; all such, 
they say, want to go to sleep, and if you try to drag them up, 
they say, "Let me sleep; it is so beautiful to sleep in the snow", 
and they die there in that sleep. So is our nature. That is what 
we are doing all our life, getting frozen from the feet upwards, 
and yet wanting to sleep. Therefore you must struggle towards 
the ideal, and if a man comes who wants to bring that ideal 
down to your level, and teach a religion that does not carry that 
highest ideal, do not listen to him. To me that is an 
impracticable religion. But if a man teaches a religion which 
presents the highest ideal, I am ready for him. Beware when 
anyone is trying to apologise for sense vanities and sense 
weaknesses.  
 
If anyone wants to preach that way to us, poor, sense-bound 
clods of earth as we have made ourselves by following that 
teaching, we shall never progress. I have seen many of these 


 
 
13 
 
things, have had some experience of the world, and my country 
is the land where religious sects grow like mushrooms. Every 
year new sects arise. But one thing I have marked, that it is only 
those that never want to reconcile the man of flesh with the man 
of truth that make progress. 
 
Wherever there is this false idea of reconciling fleshly vanities 
with the highest ideals, of dragging down God to the level of 
man, there comes decay. Man should not be degraded to 
worldly slavery, but should be raised up to God. At the same 
time, there is another side to the question. We must not look 
down with contempt on others. All of us are going towards the 
same goal.  
 
The difference between weakness and strength is one of degree; 
the difference between virtue and vice is one of degree, the 
difference between heaven and hell is one of degree, the 
difference between life and death is one of degree, all 
differences in this world are of degree, and not of kind, because 
oneness is the secret of everything. All is One, which manifests 
Itself, either as thought, or life, or soul, or body, and the 
difference is only in degree. As such, we have no right to look 
down with contempt upon those who are not developed exactly 
in the same degree as we are. Condemn none; if you can stretch 
out a helping hand, do so. If you cannot, fold your hands, bless 
your brothers, and let them go their own way.  
 
 


 
 
14 
 
Dragging down and condemning is not the way to work. Never 
is work accomplished in that way. We spend our energies in 
condemning others. Criticism and condemnation is a vain way 
of spending our energies, for in the long run we come to learn 
that all are seeing the same thing, are more or less approaching 
the same ideal, and that most of our differences are merely 
differences of expression. Take the idea of sin. I was telling you 
just now the Vedantic idea of it, and the other idea is that man 
is a sinner. They are practically the same, only the one takes the 
positive and the other the negative side. One shows to man his 
strength and the other his weakness. 
 
There may be weakness, says the Vedanta, but never mind, we 
want to grow. Disease was found out as soon as man was born. 
Everyone knows his disease; it requires no one to tell us what 
our diseases are. But thinking all the time that we are diseased 
will not cure us — medicine is necessary. We may forget 
anything outside, we may try to become hypocrites to the 
external world, but in our heart of hearts we all know our 
weaknesses. But, says the Vedanta, being reminded of weakness 
does not help much; give strength, and strength does not come 
by thinking of weakness all the time. The remedy for weakness 
is not brooding over weakness, but thinking of strength. Teach 
men of the strength that is already within them. 
 
Instead of telling them they are sinners, the Vedanta takes the 
opposite position, and says, "You are pure and perfect, and what 
you call sin does not belong to you." Sins are very low degrees 


 
 
15 
 
of Self- manifestation; manifest your Self in a high degree. That 
is the one thing to remember; all of us can do that. Never say, 
"No", never say, "I cannot", for you are infinite. Even time and 
space are as nothing compared with your nature. You can do 
anything and everything, you are almighty. These are the 
principles of ethics, but we shall now come down lower and 
work out the details. 
 
We shall see how this Vedanta can be carried into our everyday 
life, the city life, the country life, the national life, and the home 
life of every nation. For, if a religion cannot help man wherever 
he may be, wherever he stands, it is not of much use; it will 
remain only a theory for the chosen few. Religion, to help 
mankind, must be ready and able to help him in whatever 
condition he is, in servitude or in freedom, in the depths of 
degradation or on the heights of purity; everywhere, equally, it 
should be able to come to his aid. The principles of Vedanta, or 
the ideal of religion, or whatever you may call it, will be fulfilled 
by its capacity for performing this great function. 
 
The ideal of faith in ourselves is of the greatest help to us. If 
faith in ourselves had been more extensively taught and 
practiced, I am sure a very large portion of the evils and miseries 
that we have would have vanished. Throughout the history of 
mankind, if any motive power has been more potent than 
another in the lives of all great men and women, it is that of faith 
in themselves. Born with the consciousness that they were to be 
great, they became great.  


 
 
16 
 
 
Let a man go down as low as possible; there must come a time 
when out of sheer desperation he will take an upward curve and 
will learn to have faith in himself. But it is better for us that we 
should know it from the very first. Why should we have all these 
bitter experiences in order to gain faith in ourselves? We can see 
that all the difference between man and man is owing to the 
existence or non-existence of faith in himself. Faith in ourselves 
will do everything. 
 
I have experienced it in my own life, and am still doing so; and 
as I grow older that faith is becoming stronger and stronger. He 
is an atheist who does not believe in himself. The old religions 
said that he was an atheist who did not believe in God. The new 
religion says that he is the atheist who does not believe in 
himself. But it is not selfish faith because the Vedanta, again, is 
the doctrine of oneness. It means faith in all, because you are 
all. Love for yourselves means love for all, love for animals, 
love for everything, for you are all one. It is the great faith which 
will make the world better. I am sure of that. 
 
He is the highest man who can say with truth, "I know all about 
myself." Do you know how much energy, how many powers, 
how many forces are still lurking behind that frame of yours? 
 
What scientist has known all that is in man? Millions of years 
have passed since man first came here, and yet but one 
infinitesimal part of his powers has been manifested. Therefore, 


 
 
17 
 
you must not say that you are weak. How do you know what 
possibilities lie behind that degradation on the surface? You 
know but little of that which is within you. For behind you is the 
ocean of infinite power and blessedness.  
 
“This Âtman is first to be heard of.” Hear day and night that you 
are that Soul. Repeat it to yourselves day and night till it enters 
into your very veins, till it tingles in every drop of blood, till it 
is in your flesh and bone. Let the whole body be full of that one 
ideal, "I am the birthless, the deathless, the blissful, the 
omniscient, the omnipotent, ever-glorious Soul." Think on it 
day and night; think on it till it becomes part and parcel of your 
life. Meditate upon it, and out of that will come work. "Out of 
the fullness of the heart the mouth speaketh," and out of the 
fullness of the heart the hand worketh also. Action will come. 
Fill yourselves with the ideal; whatever you do, think well on it. 
All your actions will be magnified, transformed, deified, by the 
very power of the thought. If matter is powerful, thought is 
omnipotent. 
 
Bring this thought to bear upon your life, fill yourselves with 
the thought of your almightiness, your majesty, and your glory. 
Would to God no superstitions had been put into your head! 
Would to God we had not been surrounded from our birth by all 
these superstitious influences and paralysing ideas of our 
weakness and vileness! Would to God that mankind had had an 
easier path through which to attain to the noblest and highest 
truths! But man had to pass through all this; do not make the 


 
 
18 
 
path more difficult for those who are coming after you. These 
are sometimes terrible doctrines to teach. I know people who get 
frightened at these ideas, but for those who want to be practical, 
this is the first thing to learn. Never tell yourselves or others that 
you are weak. Do good if you can, but do not injure the world. 
You know in your inmost heart that many of your limited ideas, 
this humbling of yourself and praying and weeping to imaginary 
beings are superstitions.  
 
Tell me one case where these prayers have been answered. All 
the answers that came were from your own hearts. You know 
there are no ghosts, but no sooner are you in the dark than you 
feel a little creepy sensation. That is so because in our childhood 
we have had all these fearful ideas put into our heads. But do 
not teach these things to others through fear of society and 
public opinion, through fear of incurring the hatred of friends, 
or for fear of losing cherished superstitions. Be masters of all 
these. What is there to be taught more in religion than the 
oneness of the universe and faith in one's self? All the works of 
mankind for thousands of years past have been towards this one 
goal, and mankind is yet working it out. It is your turn now and 
you already know the truth.  
 
For it has been taught on all sides. Not only philosophy and 
psychology, but materialistic sciences have declared it. Where 
is the scientific man today who fears to acknowledge the truth of 
this oneness of the universe? Who is there who dares talk of 
many worlds? All these are superstitions. There is only one life 


 
 
19 
 
and one world, and this one life and one world is appearing to 
us as manifold. This manifoldness is like a dream. When you 
dream, one dream passes away and another comes. You do not 
live in your dreams. The dreams come one after another, scene 
after scene unfolds before you. So it is in this world of ninety 
per cent misery and ten per cent happiness. Perhaps after a while 
it will appear as ninety per cent happiness, and we shall call it 
heaven, but a time comes to the sage when the whole thing 
vanishes, and this world appears as God Himself, and his own 
soul as God. It is not therefore that there are many worlds, it is 
not that there are many lives.  
 
All this manifoldness is the manifestation of that One. That One 
is manifesting Himself as many, as matter, spirit, mind, thought, 
and everything else. It is that One, manifesting Himself as many. 
Therefore the first step for us to take is to teach the truth to 
ourselves and to others. Let the world resound with this ideal, 
and let superstitions vanish. Tell it to men who are weak and 
persist in telling it. You are the Pure One; awake and arise, O 
mighty one, this sleep does not become you. Awake and arise, 
it does not befit you. Think not that you are weak and miserable. 
Almighty, arise and awake, and manifest your own nature. It is 
not fitting that you think yourself a sinner. It is not fitting that 
you think yourself weak.  
 
Say that to the world, say it to yourselves, and see what a 
practical result comes, see how with an electric flash everything 
is manifested, how everything is changed. Tell that to mankind, 


 
 
20 
 
and show them their power. Then we shall learn how to apply it 
in our daily lives. To be able to use what we call Viveka 
(discrimination), to learn how in every moment of our lives, in 
every one of our actions, to discriminate between what is right 
and wrong, true and false, we shall have to know the test of truth, 
which is purity, oneness. Everything that makes for oneness is 
truth. Love is truth, and hatred is false, because hatred makes 
for multiplicity. It is hatred that separates man from man; 
therefore it is wrong and false. It is a disintegrating power; it 
separates and destroys. Love binds, love makes for that oneness. 
You become one, the mother with the child, families with the 
city, the whole world becomes one with the animals.  
 
For love is Existence, God Himself; and all this is the 
manifestation of that One Love, more or less expressed. The 
difference is only in degree, but it is the manifestation of that 
One Love throughout. Therefore in all our actions we have to 
judge whether it is making for diversity or for oneness. If for 
diversity we have to give it up, but if it makes for oneness we 
are sure it is good. So with our thoughts; we have to decide 
whether they make for disintegration, multiplicity, or for 
oneness, binding soul to soul and bringing one influence to bear. 
 
If they do this, we will take them up, and if not, we will throw 
them off as criminal. The whole idea of ethics is that it does not 
depend on anything unknowable, it does not teach anything 
unknown, but in the language of the Upanishad, "The God 
whom you worship as an unknown God, the same I preach unto 


 
 
21 
 
thee." It is through the Self that you know anything. I see the 
chair; but to see the chair, I have first to perceive myself and 
then the chair. It is in and through the Self that the chair is 
perceived.  
 
It is in and through the Self that you are known to me, that the 
whole world is known to me; and therefore to say this Self is 
unknown is sheer nonsense. Take off the Self and the whole 
universe vanishes. In and through the Self all knowledge comes. 
Therefore it is the best known of all. It is yourself, that which 
you call I. You may wonder how this I of me can be the I of you. 
You may wonder how this limited I can be the unlimited 
Infinite, but it is so. The limited is a mere fiction. 
 
The Infinite has been covered up, as it were, and a little of It is 
manifesting as the I. Limitation can never come upon the 
unlimited; it is a fiction. The Self is known, therefore, to every 
one of us — man, woman, or child — and even to animals. 
Without knowing Him we can neither live nor move, nor have 
our being; without knowing this Lord of all, we cannot breathe 
or live a second. The God of the Vedanta is the most known of 
all and is not the outcome of imagination. If this is not preaching 
a practical God, how else could you teach a practical God? 
Where is there a more practical God than He whom I see before 
me — a God omnipresent, in every being, more real than our 
senses? For you are He, the Omnipresent God Almighty, the 
Soul of your souls, and if I say you are not, I tell an untruth. I 
know it, whether at all times I realise it or not. He is the Oneness, 


 
 
22 
 
the Unity of all, the Reality of all life and all existence. These 
ideas of the ethics of Vedanta have to be worked out in detail, 
and, therefore, you must have patience. As I have told you, we 
want to take the subject in detail and work it up thoroughly, to 
see how the ideas grow from very low ideals, and how the one 
great Ideal of oneness has developed and become shaped into 
the universal love; and we ought to study these in order to avoid 
dangers. 
 
The world cannot find time to work it up from the lowest steps. 
But what is the use of our standing on higher steps if we cannot 
give the truth to others coming afterwards? Therefore, it is better 
to study it in all its workings; and first, it is absolutely necessary 
to clear the intellectual portion, although we know that 
intellectuality is almost nothing; for it is the heart that is of most 
importance. It is through the heart that the Lord is seen, and not 
through the intellect. The intellect is only the street- cleaner, 
cleansing the path for us, a secondary worker, the policeman; 
but the policeman is not a positive necessity for the workings of 
society. He is only to stop disturbances, to check wrong-doing, 
and that is all the work required of the intellect. When you read 
intellectual books, you think when you have mastered them, 
"Bless the Lord that I am out of them", because the intellect is 
blind and cannot move of itself, it has neither hands nor feet.  
 
It is feeling that works, that moves with speed infinitely superior 
to that of electricity or anything else. Do you feel? — that is the 
question. If you do, you will see the Lord: It is the feeling that 


 
 
23 
 
you have today that will be intensified, deified, raised to the 
highest platform, until it feels everything, the oneness in 
everything, till it feels God in itself and in others. The intellect 
can never do that. "Different methods of speaking words, 
different methods of explaining the texts of books, these are for 
the enjoyment of the learned, not for the salvation of the soul" 
(Vivekachudâmani, 58). Those of you who have read Thomas a 
Kempis know how in every page he insists on this, and almost 
every holy man in the world has insisted on it. Intellect is 
necessary, for without it we fall into crude errors and make all 
sorts of mistakes. Intellect checks these; but beyond that, do not 
try to build anything upon it. It is an inactive, secondary help; 
the real help is feeling, love. 
 
Do you feel for others? If you do, you are growing in oneness. 
If you do not feel for others, you may be the most intellectual 
giant ever born, but you will be nothing; you are but dry 
intellect, and you will remain so. And if you feel, even if you 
cannot read any book and do not know any language, you are in 
the right way. The Lord is yours. Do you not know from the 
history of the world where the power of the prophets lay? Where 
was it? In the intellect? Did any of them write a fine book on 
philosophy, on the most intricate ratiocinations of logic? Not 
one of them. 
 
They only spoke a few words. Feel like Christ and you will be a 
Christ; feel like Buddha and you will be a Buddha. It is feeling 
that is the life, the strength, the vitality, without which no 


 
 
24 
 
amount of intellectual activity can reach God. Intellect is like 
limbs without the power of locomotion. It is only when feeling 
enters and gives them motion that they move and work on 
others. That is so all over the world, and it is a thing which you 
must always remember. It is one of the most practical things in 
Vedantic morality, for it is the teaching of the Vedanta that you 
are all prophets, and all must be prophets. 
 
The book is not the proof of your conduct, but you are the proof 
of the book. How do you know that a book teaches truth? 
Because you are truth and feel it. That is what the Vedanta says. 
What is the proof of the Christs and Buddhas of the world? That 
you and I feel like them. That is how you and I understand that 
they were true. Our prophet-soul is the proof of their prophet-
soul. Your godhead is the proof of God Himself. If you are not 
a prophet, there never has been anything true of God. If you are 
not God, there never was any God, and never will be. 
 
This, says the Vedanta, is the ideal to follow. Every one of us 
will have to become a prophet, and you are that already. Only 
know it. Never think there is anything impossible for the soul. It 
is the greatest heresy to think so. If there is sin, this is the only 
sin — to say that you are weak, or others are weak.

Part - 2 
(Delivered in London, 12th November 1896) 
 
 
I will relate to you a very ancient story from the Chhândogya 
Upanishad, which tells how knowledge came to a boy. The 
 form of the story is very crude, but we shall find that it contains 
a principle. A young boy said to his mother, "I am going to 
study the Vedas. Tell me the name of my father and my caste." 
The mother was not a married woman, and in India the child of 
a woman who has not been married is considered an outcast; he 
is not recognised by society and is not entitled to study the 
Vedas. So the poor mother said, "My child, I do not know your 
family name; I was in service, and served in different places; I 
do not know who your father is, but my name is Jabâlâ and your 
name is Satyakâma." The little child went to a sage and asked 
to be taken as a student.  
 
The sage asked him, "What is the name of your father, and what 
is your caste?" The boy repeated to him what he had heard from 
his mother. The sage at once said, "None but a Brâhmin could 
speak such a damaging truth about himself. You are a Brahmin 
and I will teach you. You have not swerved from truth." So he 
kept the boy with him and educated him. Now come some of 


 
 
26 
 
the peculiar methods of education in ancient India. This teacher 
gave Satyakama four hundred lean, weak cows to take care of, 
and sent him to the forest. There he went and lived for some 
time. The teacher had told him to come back when the herd 
would increase to the number of one thousand. After a few 
years, one day Satyakama heard a big bull in the herd saying to 
him, "We are a thousand now; take us back to your teacher. I 
will teach you a little of Brahman." "Say on, sir," said 
Satyakama. Then the bull said, "The East is a part of the Lord, 
so is the West, so is the South, so is the North. The four cardinal 
points are the four parts of Brahman. Fire will also teach you 
something of Brahman." Fire was a great symbol in those days, 
and every student had to procure fire and make offerings.  
 
So on the following day, Satyakama started for his Guru's 
house, and when in the evening he had performed his oblation, 
and worshipped at the fire, and was  sitting near it, he heard a 
voice come from the fire, "O Satyakama." "Speak, Lord," said 
Satyakama. (Perhaps you may remember a very similar story in 
the Old Testament, how Samuel heard a mysterious voice.) "O 
Satyakama, I am come to teach you a little of Brahman. This 
earth is a portion of that Brahman. The sky and the heaven are 
portions of It. The ocean is a part of that Brahman." Then the 
fire said that a certain bird would also teach him something. 
 
Satyakama continued his journey and on the next day when he 
had performed his evening sacrifice a swan came to him and 
said, "I will teach you something about Brahman. This fire 


 
 
27 
 
which you worship, O Satyakama, is a part of that Brahman. 
The sun is a part, the moon is a part, the lightning is a part of 
that Brahman. A bird called Madgu will tell you more about it." 
The next evening that bird came, and a similar voice was heard 
by Satyakama, "I will tell you something about Brahman. 
Breath is a part of Brahman, sight is a part, hearing is a part, the 
mind is a part." Then the boy arrived at his teacher's place and 
presented himself before him with due reverence. No sooner 
had the teacher seen this disciple than he remarked: 
"Satyakama, thy face shines like that of a knower of Brahman! 
Who then has taught thee?" "Beings other than men," replied 
Satyakama. "But I wish that you should teach me, sir. For I have 
heard from men like you that knowledge which is learnt from a 
Guru alone leads to the supreme good." Then the sage taught 
him the same knowledge which he had received from the gods. 
"And nothing was left out, yea, nothing was left out." Now, 
apart from the allegories of what the bull, the fire, and the birds 
taught, we see the tendency of the thought and the direction in 
which it was going in those days.  
 
The great idea of which we here see the germ is that all these 
voices are inside ourselves. As we understand these truths 
better, we find that the voice is in our own heart, and the student 
understood that all the time he was hearing the truth; but his 
explanation was not correct. He was interpreting the voice as 
coming from the external world, while all the time, it was within 
him. The second idea that we get is that of making the 
knowledge of the Brahman practical. The world is always 
seeking the practical possibilities of religion, and we find in 


 
 
28 
 
these stories how it was becoming more and more practical 
every day. The truth was shown through everything with which 
the students were familiar. The fire they were worshipping was 
Brahman, the earth was a part of Brahman, and so on. 
 
The next story belongs to Upakosala Kâmalâyana, a disciple of 
this Satyakama, who went to be taught by him and dwelt with 
him for some time. Now Satyakama went away on a journey, 
and the student became very downhearted; and when the 
teacher's wife came and asked him why he was not eating, the 
boy said, "I am too unhappy to eat." Then a voice came from 
the fire he was worshipping, saying "This life is Brahman, 
Brahman is the ether, and Brahman is happiness. Know 
Brahman." "I know, sir," the boy replied, "that life is Brahman, 
but that It is ether and happiness I do not know." Then it 
explained that the two words ether and happiness signified one 
thing in reality, viz. the sentient ether (pure intelligence) that 
resides in the heart. So, it taught him Brahman as life and as the 
ether in the heart.  
 
Then the fire taught him, "This earth, food, fire, and sun whom 
you worship, are forms of Brahman. The person that is seen in 
the sun, I am He. He who knows this and meditates on Him, all 
his sins vanish and he has long life and becomes happy. He who 
lives in the cardinal points, the moon, the stars, and the water, I 
am He. He who lives in this life, the ether, the heavens, and the 
lightning, I am He." Here too we see the same idea of practical 
religion. The things which they were worshipping, such as the 


 
 
29 
 
fire, the sun, the moon, and so forth, and the voice with which 
they were familiar, form the subject of the stories which explain 
them and give them a higher meaning. And this is the real, 
practical side of Vedanta. It does not destroy the world, but it 
explains it; it does not destroy the person, but explains him; it 
does not destroy the individuality, but explains it by showing 
the real individuality. 
 
It does not show that this world is vain and does not exist, but 
it says, "Understand what this world is, so that it may not hurt 
you." The voice did not say to Upakosala that the fire which he 
was worshipping, or the sun, or the moon, or the lightning, or 
anything else, was all wrong, but it showed him that the same 
spirit which was inside the sun, and moon, and lightning, and 
the fire, and the earth, was in him, so that everything became 
transformed, as it were, in the eyes of Upakosala. The fire which 
was merely a material fire before, in which to make oblations, 
assumed a new aspect and became the Lord. The earth became 
transformed, life became transformed, the sun, the moon, the 
stars, the lightning, everything became transformed and deified. 
Their real nature was known. The theme of the Vedanta is to 
see the Lord in everything, to see things in their real nature, not 
as they appear to be.  
 
Then another lesson is taught in the Upanishads: "He who 
shines through the eyes is Brahman; He is the Beautiful One, 
He is the Shining One. He shines in all these worlds." A certain 
peculiar light, a commentator says, which comes to the pure 


 
 
30 
 
man, is what is meant by the light in the eyes, and it is said that 
when a man is pure such a light will shine in his eyes, and that 
light belongs really to the Soul within, which is everywhere. It 
is the same light which shines in the planets, in the stars, and 
suns. I will now read to you some other doctrine of these ancient 
Upanishads, about birth and death and so on. Perhaps it will 
interest you. Shvetaketu went to the king of the Panchâlas, and 
the king asked him, "Do you know where people go when they 
die? Do you know how they come back? Do you know why the 
other world does not become full?" The boy replied that he did 
not know. 
 
Then he went to his father and asked him the same questions. 
The father said, "I do not know," and he went to the king. The 
king said that this knowledge was never known to the priests, it 
was only with the kings, and that was the reason why kings ruled 
the world. This man stayed with the king for some time, for the 
king said he would teach him. "The other world, O Gautama, is 
the fire. The sun is its fuel. The rays are the smoke. The day is 
the flame. The moon is the embers. And the stars are the sparks. 
In this fire the gods pour libation of faith and from this libation 
king Soma is born." So on he goes. "You need not make oblation 
to that little fire: the whole world is that fire, and this oblation, 
this worship, is continually going on. The gods, and the angels, 
and everybody is worshipping it. Man is the greatest symbol of 
fire, the body of man." Here also we see the ideal becoming 
practical and Brahman is seen in everything.  
 


 
 
31 
 
The principle that underlies all these stories is that invented 
symbolism may be good and helpful, but already better symbols 
exist than any we can invent. You may invent an image through 
which to worship God, but a better image already exists, the 
living man. You may build a temple in which to worship God, 
and that may be good, but a better one, a much higher one, 
already exists, the human body. You remember that the Vedas 
have two parts, the ceremonial and the knowledge portions. In 
time ceremonials had multiplied and become  so intricate that it 
was almost hopeless to disentangle them, and so in the 
Upanishads we find that the ceremonials are almost done away 
with, but gently, by explaining them. We see that in old times 
they had these oblations and sacrifices, then the philosophers 
came, and instead of snatching away the symbols from the hands 
of the ignorant, instead of taking the negative position, which 
we unfortunately find so general in modern reforms, they gave 
them something to take their place. 
 
"Here is the symbol of fire," they said. "Very good! But here is 
another symbol, the earth. What a grand, great symbol! Here is 
this little temple, but the whole universe is a temple; a man can 
worship anywhere. There are the peculiar figures that men draw 
on the earth, and there are the altars, but here is the greatest of 
altars, the living, conscious human body, and to worship at this 
altar is far higher than the worship of any dead symbols." We 
now come to a peculiar doctrine. 
 
 


 
 
32 
 
I do not understand much of it myself. If you can make 
something out of it, I will read it to you. When a man dies, who 
has by meditation purified himself and got knowledge, he first 
goes to light, then from light to day, from day to the light half 
of the moon, from that to the six months when the sun goes to 
the north, from that to the year, from the year to the sun, from 
the sun to the moon, from the moon to the lightning, and when 
he comes to the sphere of lightning, he meets a person who is 
not human, and that person leads him to (the conditioned) 
Brahman. This is the way of the gods. When sages and wise 
persons die, they go that way and they do not return.  
 
What is meant by this month and year, and all these things, no 
one understands clearly. Each one gives his own meaning, and 
some say it is all nonsense. What is meant by going to the world 
of the moon and of the sun, and this person who comes to help 
the soul after it has reached the sphere of lightning, no one 
knows. There is an idea among the Hindus that the moon is a 
place where life exists, and we shall see how life has come from 
there. Those that have not attained to knowledge, but have done 
good work in this life, first go, when they die, through smoke, 
then to night, then to the dark fifteen days, then to the six months 
when the sun goes to the south, and from that they go to the 
region of their forefathers, then to ether, then to the region of the 
moon, and there become the food of the gods, and later, are born 
as gods and live there so long as their good works will permit. 
And when the effect of the good work has been finished, they 
come back to earth by the same route. They first become ether, 


 
 
33 
 
and then air, and then smoke, and then mist, then cloud, and then 
fall upon the earth as raindrops; then they get into food, which 
is eaten up by human beings, and finally become their children. 
Those whose works have been very good take birth in good 
families, and those whose works have been bad take bad births, 
even in animal bodies.  
 
Animals are continually coming to and going from this earth. 
That is why the earth is neither full nor empty. Several ideas we 
can get also from this, and later on, perhaps, we shall be able to 
understand it better, and we can speculate a little upon what it 
means. The last part which deals with how those who have been 
in heaven return, is clearer, perhaps, than the first part; but the 
whole idea seems to be this that there is no permanent heaven 
without realising God. Now some people who have not realised 
God, but have done good work in this world, with the view of 
enjoying the results, go, when they die, through this and that 
place, until they reach heaven, and there they are born in the 
same way as we are here, as children of the gods, and they live 
there as long as their good works will permit.  
 
Out of this comes one basic idea of the Vedanta that everything 
which has name and form is transient. This earth is transient, 
because it has name and form, and so the heavens must be 
transient, because there also name and form remain. A heaven 
which is eternal will be contradictory in terms, because 
everything that has name and form must begin in time, exist in 
time, and end in time. These are settled doctrines of the Vedanta, 


 
 
34 
 
and as such the heavens are given up. We have seen in the 
Samhitâ that the idea of heaven was that it was eternal, much 
the same as is prevalent among Mohammedans and Christians.  
 
The Mohammedans concretize it a little more. They say it is a 
place where there are gardens, beneath which rivers run. In the 
desert of Arabia water is very desirable, so the Mohammedan 
always conceives of his heaven as containing much water. I was 
born in a country where there are six months of rain every year. 
I should think of heaven, I suppose, as a dry place, and so also 
would the English people. These heavens in the Samhita are 
eternal, and the departed have beautiful bodies and live with 
their forefathers, and are happy ever afterwards. There they 
meet with their parents, children, and other relatives, and lead 
very much the same sort of life as here, only much happier. All 
the difficulties and obstructions to happiness in this life have 
vanished, and only its good parts and enjoyments remain. But 
however comfortable mankind may consider this state of things, 
truth is one thing and comfort is another. There are cases where 
truth is not comfortable until we reach its climax. Human nature 
is very conservative. It does something, and having once done 
that, finds it hard to get out of it. The mind will not receive new 
thoughts, because they bring discomfort. 
 
In the Upanishads, we see a tremendous departure made. It is 
declared that these heavens in which men live with the ancestors 
after death cannot be permanent, seeing that everything which 
has name and form must die. If there are heavens with forms, 


 
 
35 
 
these heavens must vanish in course of time; they may last 
millions of years, but there must come a time when they will 
have to go. With this idea came another that these souls must 
come back to earth, and that heavens are places where they 
enjoy the results of their good works, and after these effects are 
finished they come back into this earth life again. One thing is 
clear from this that mankind had a perception of the philosophy 
of causation even at the early time. Later on we shall see how 
our philosophers bring that out in the language of philosophy 
and logic, but here it is almost in the language of children. One 
thing you may remark in reading these books that it is all internal 
perception. 
 
If you ask me if this can be practical, my answer is, it has been 
practical first, and philosophical next. You can see that first 
these things have been perceived and realised and then written. 
This world spoke to the early thinkers. Birds spoke to them, 
animals spoke to them, the sun and the moon spoke to them; and 
little by little they realised things, and got into the heart of 
nature. Not by cogitation not by the force of logic, not by 
picking the brains of others and making a big book, as is the 
fashion in modern times, not even as I do, by taking up one of 
their writings and making a long lecture, but by patient 
investigation and discovery they found out the truth. Its essential 
method was practice, and so it must be always. 
 
Religion is ever a practical science, and there never was nor will 
be any theological religion. It is practice first, and knowledge 


 
 
36 
 
afterwards. The idea that souls come back is already there. 
Those persons who do good work with the idea of a result, get 
it, but the result is not permanent. There we get the idea of 
causation very beautifully put forward, that the effect is only 
commensurate with the cause. As the cause is, so the effect will 
be. The cause being finite, the effect must be finite. If the cause 
is eternal the effect can be eternal, but all these causes, doing 
good work, and all other things, are only finite causes, and as 
such cannot produce infinite result.  
 
We now come to the other side of the question. As there cannot 
be an eternal heaven, on the same grounds, there cannot be an 
eternal hell. Suppose I am a very wicked man, doing evil every 
minute of my life. Still, my whole life here, compared with my 
eternal life, is nothing. If there be an eternal punishment, it will 
mean that there is an infinite effect produced by a finite cause, 
which cannot be. If I do good all my life, I cannot have an 
infinite heaven; it would be making the same mistake. But there 
is a third course which applies to those who have known the 
Truth, to those who have realised It. This is the only way to get 
beyond this veil of Mâyâ — to realise what Truth is; and the 
Upanishads indicate what is meant by realising the Truth. 
 
It means recognising neither good nor bad, but knowing all as 
coming from the Self; Self is in everything. It means denying 
the universe; shutting your eyes to it; seeing the Lord in hell as 
well as in heaven; seeing the Lord in death as well as in life. This 
is the line of thought in the passage I have read to you; the earth 


 
 
37 
 
is a symbol of the Lord, the sky is the Lord, the place we fill is 
the Lord, everything is Brahman. And this is to be seen, realised, 
not simply talked or thought about. We can see as its logical 
consequence that when the soul has realised that everything is 
full of the Lord, of Brahman, it will not care whether it goes to 
heaven, or hell, or anywhere else; whether it be born again on 
this earth or in heaven. These things have ceased to have any 
meaning to that soul, because every place is the same, every 
place is the temple of the Lord, every place has become holy and 
the presence of the Lord is all that it sees in heaven, or hell, or 
anywhere else. Neither good nor bad, neither life nor death — 
only the one infinite Brahman exists. 
 
According to the Vedanta, when a man has arrived at that 
perception, he has become free, and he is the only man who is 
fit to live in this world. Others are not. The man who sees evil, 
how can he live in this world? His life is a mass of misery. The 
man who sees dangers, his life is a misery; the man who sees 
death, his life is a misery. That man alone can live in this world, 
he alone can say, "I enjoy this life, and I am happy in this life". 
who has seen the Truth, and the Truth in everything. By the by, 
I may tell you that the idea of hell does not occur in the Vedas 
anywhere. It comes with the Purânas much later. 
 
The worst punishment according to the Vedas is coming back to 
earth, having another chance in this world. From the very first 
we see the idea is taking the impersonal turn. The ideas of 
punishment and reward are very material, and they are only 


 
 
38 
 
consonant with the idea of a human God, who loves one and 
hates another, just as we do. Punishment and reward are only 
admissible with the existence of such a God.  
 
They had such a God in the Samhita, and there we find the idea 
of fear entering, but as soon as we come to the Upanishads, the 
idea of fear vanishes, and the impersonal idea takes its place. It 
is naturally the hardest thing for man to understand, this 
impersonal idea, for he is always clinging on to the person. Even 
people who are thought to be great thinkers get disgusted at the 
idea of the Impersonal God. But to me it seems so absurd to 
think of God as an embodied man. Which is the higher idea, a 
living God, or a dead God? A God whom nobody sees, nobody 
knows, or a God Known? The Impersonal God is a living God, 
a principle. The difference between personal and impersonal is 
this, that the personal is only a man, and the impersonal idea is 
that He is the angel, the man, the animal, and yet something more 
which we cannot see, because impersonality includes all 
personalities, is the sum total of everything in the universe, and 
infinitely more besides. "As the one fire coming into the world 
is manifesting itself in so many forms, and yet is infinitely more 
besides," so is the Impersonal. We want to worship a living God. 
I have seen nothing but God all my life, nor have you. To see 
this chair you first see God, and then the chair in and through 
Him. He is everywhere saying, "I am". The moment you feel "I 
am", you are conscious of Existence. 
 
 


 
 
39 
 
Where shall we go to find God if we cannot see Him in our own 
hearts and in every living being? "Thou art the man, Thou art the 
woman, Thou art the girl, and Thou art the boy. Thou art the old 
man tottering with a stick. 
 
Thou art the young man walking in the pride of his strength." 
Thou art all that exists, a wonderful living God who is the only 
fact in the universe. This seems to many to be a terrible 
contradiction to the traditional God who lives behind a veil 
somewhere and whom nobody ever sees. The priests only give 
us an assurance that if we follow them, listen to their 
admonitions, and walk in the way they mark out for us — then 
when we die, they will give us a passport to enable us to see the 
face of God! What are all these heaven ideas but simply 
modifications of this nonsensical priestcraft? Of course the 
impersonal idea is very destructive, it takes away all trade from 
the priests, churches, and temples. In India there is a famine 
now, but there are temples in each one of which there are jewels 
worth a king's ransom! If the priests taught this Impersonal idea 
to the people, their occupation would be gone. Yet we have to 
teach it unselfishly, without priestcraft. 
 
You are God and so am I; who obeys whom? Who worships 
whom? You are the highest temple of God; I would rather
 
worship you than any temple, image, or Bible. Why are some 
people so contradictory in their thought? They are like fish 
slipping through our fingers. They say they are hard-headed 
practical men. Very good. But what is more practical than 


 
 
40 
 
worshipping here, worshipping you? I see you, feel you, and I 
know you are God. The Mohammedan says, there is no God but 
Allah. The Vedanta says, there is nothing that is not God. It may 
frighten many of you, but you will understand it by degrees.  
 
The living God is within you, and yet you are building churches 
and temples and believing all sorts of imaginary nonsense. The 
only God to worship is the human soul in the human body. Of 
course all animals are temples too, but man is the highest, the 
Taj Mahal of temples. If I cannot worship in that, no other 
temple will be of any advantage. The moment I have realised 
God sitting in the temple of every human body, the moment I 
stand in reverence before every human being and see God in 
him — that moment I am free from bondage, everything that 
binds vanishes, and I am free. 
 
This is the most practical of all worship. It has nothing to do 
with theorising and speculation. Yet it frightens many. They say 
it is not right. They go on theorising about old ideals told them 
by their grandfathers, that a God somewhere in heaven had told 
some one that he was God. Since that time we have only 
theories. This is practicality according to them, and our ideas are 
impractical! No doubt, the Vedanta says that each one must have 
his own path, but the path is not the goal. 
 
The worship of a God in heaven and all these things are not bad, 
but they are only steps towards the Truth and not the Truth itself. 
They are good and beautiful, and some wonderful ideas are 


 
 
41 
 
there, but the Vedanta says at every point, "My friend, Him 
whom you are worshiping as unknown, I worship as thee. He 
whom you are worshipping as unknown and are seeking for, 
throughout the universe, has been with you all the time. You are 
living through Him, and He is the Eternal Witness of the 
universe." "He whom all the Vedas worship, nay, more, He who 
is always present in the eternal 'I'. He existing, the whole 
universe exists. He is the light and life of the universe. If the 'I' 
were not in you, you would not see the sun, everything would 
be a dark mass. He shining, you see the world." One question is 
generally asked, and it is this that this may lead to a tremendous 
amount of difficulty. 
 
Every one of us will think, "I am God, and whatever I do or 
think must be good, for God can do no evil." In the first place, 
even taking this danger of misinterpretation for granted, can it 
be proved that on the other side the same danger does not exist? 
They have been worshipping a God in heaven separate from 
them, and of whom they are much afraid. They have been born 
shaking with fear, and all their life they will go on shaking. Has 
the world been made much better by this? Those who have 
understood and worshipped a Personal God, and those who have 
understood and worshipped an Impersonal God, on which side 
have been the great workers of the world — gigantic workers, 
gigantic moral powers? Certainly, on the Impersonal. How can 
you expect morality to be developed through fear? It can never 
be. "Where one sees another, where one hears another, that is 
Maya. When one does not see another, when one does not hear 


 
 
42 
 
another, when everything has become the Atman, who sees 
whom, who perceives whom?" It is all He, and all I, at the same 
time.  
 
The soul has become pure. Then, and then alone we understand 
what love is. Love cannot come through fear, its basis is 
freedom. When we really begin to love the world, then we 
understand what is meant by brotherhood or mankind, and not 
before. So, it is not right to say that the Impersonal idea will lead 
to a tremendous amount of evil in the world, as if the other 
doctrine never lent itself to works of evil, as if it did not lead to 
sectarianism deluging the world with blood and causing men to 
tear each other to pieces. "My God is the greatest God, let us 
decide it by a free fight." That is the outcome of dualism all over 
the world. 
 
Come out into the broad open light of day, come out from the 
little narrow paths, for how can the infinite soul rest content to 
live and die in small ruts? Come out into the universe of Light. 
Everything in the universe is yours, stretch out your arms and 
embrace it with love. If you ever felt you wanted to do that, you 
have felt God. You remember that passage in the sermon of 
Buddha, how he sent a thought of love towards the south, the 
north, the east, and the west, above and below, until the whole 
universe was filled with this lose, so grand, great, and infinite. 
When you have that feeling, you have true personality. 
  
 


 
 
43 
 
The whole universe is one person; let go the little things. Give 
up the small for the Infinite, give up small enjoyments for 
infinite bliss. It is all yours, for the Impersonal includes the 
Personal. So, God is Personal and Impersonal at the same time. 
And Man, the Infinite, Impersonal Man, is manifesting Himself 
as person. We the infinite have limited ourselves, as it were, into 
small parts. The Vedanta says that Infinity is our true nature; it 
will never vanish, it will abide forever. But we are limiting 
ourselves by our Karma, which like a chain round our necks has 
dragged us into this limitation. Break that chain and be free. 
 
Trample law under your feet. There is no law in human nature, 
there is no destiny, no fate. How can there be law in infinity? 
Freedom is its watchword. Freedom is its nature, its birthright. 
Be free, and then have any number of personalities you like. 
Then we will play like the actor who comes upon the stage and 
plays the part of a beggar. Contrast him with the actual beggar 
walking in the streets. The scene is, perhaps, the same in both 
cases, the words are, perhaps, the same, but yet what difference! 
The one enjoys his beggary while the other is suffering misery 
from it. And what makes this difference?  
 
The one is free and the other is bound. The actor knows his 
beggary is not true, but that he has assumed it for play, while the 
real beggar thinks that it is his too familiar state and that he has 
to bear it whether he wills it or not. This is the law. So long as 
we have no knowledge of our real nature, we are beggars, jostled 
about by every force in nature; and made slaves of by everything 


 
 
44 
 
in nature; we cry all over the world for help, but help never 
comes to us; we cry to imaginary beings, and yet it never comes.  
 
But still we hope help will come, and thus in weeping, wailing, 
and hoping, one life is passed, and the same play goes on and 
on. Be free; hope for nothing from anyone. I am sure if you look 
back upon your lives you will find that you were always vainly 
trying to get help from others which never came.  
 
All the help that has come was from within yourselves. You 
only had the fruits of what you yourselves worked for, and yet 
you were strangely hoping all the time for help. A rich man's 
parlour is always full; but if you notice, you do not find the same 
people there. The visitors are always hoping that they will get 
something from those wealthy men, but they never do. So are 
our lives spent in hoping, hoping, hoping, which never comes to 
an end. Give up hope, says the Vedanta. Why should you hope? 
You have everything, nay, you are everything. What are you 
hoping for? If a king goes mad, and runs about trying to find the 
king of his country, he will never find him, because he is the 
king himself. He may go through every village and city in his 
own country, seeking in every house, weeping and wailing, but 
he will never find him, because he is the king himself.  
 
It is better that we know we are God and give up this fool's 
search after Him; and knowing that we are God we become 
happy and contented. Give up all these mad pursuits, and then 
play your part in the universe, as an actor on the stage. The 


 
 
45 
 
whole vision is changed, and instead of an eternal prison this 
world has become a playground; instead of a land of 
competition it is a land of bliss, where there is perpetual spring, 
flowers bloom and butterflies flit about. This very world 
becomes heaven, which formerly was hell. To the eyes of the 
bound it is a tremendous place of torment, but to the eyes of the 
free it is quite otherwise. 
 
 This one life is the universal life, heavens and all those places 
are here. All the gods are here, the prototypes of man. The gods 
did not create man after their type, but man created gods. And 
here are the prototypes, here is Indra, here is Varuna, and all the 
gods of the universe. We have been projecting our little doubles, 
and we are the originals of these gods, we are the real, the only 
gods to be worshipped. This is the view of the Vedanta, and this 
its practicality. When we have become free, we need not go mad 
and throw up society and rush off to die in the forest or the cave; 
we shall remain where we were, only we shall understand the 
whole thing. 
 
The same phenomena will remain, but with a new meaning. We 
do not know the world yet; it is only through freedom that we 
see what it is, and understand its nature. We shall see then that 
this so-called law, or fate, or destiny occupied only an 
infinitesimal part of our nature. It was only one side, but on the 
other side there was freedom all the time. We did not know this, 
and that is why we have been trying to save ourselves from evil 
by hiding our faces in the ground, like the hunted hare. Through 


 
 
46 
 
delusion we have been trying to forget our nature, and yet we 
could not; it was always calling upon us, and all our search after 
God or gods, or external freedom, was a search after our real 
nature. We mistook the voice. We thought it was from the fire, 
or from a god or the sun, or moon, or stars, but at last we have 
found that it was from within ourselves. Within ourselves is this 
eternal voice speaking of eternal freedom; its music is eternally 
going on. Part of this music of the Soul has become the earth, 
the law, this universe, but it was always ours and always will be. 
In one word, the ideal of Vedanta is to know man as he really is, 
and this is its message, that if you cannot worship your brother 
man, the manifested God, how can you worship a God who is 
unmanifested? Do you not remember what the Bible says, "If 
you cannot love your brother whom you have seen, how can you 
love God whom you have not seen?" If you cannot see God in 
the human face, how can you see him in the clouds, or in images 
made of dull, dead matter, or in mere fictitious stories of our 
brain? I shall call you religious from the day you begin to see 
God in men and women, and then you will understand what is 
meant by turning the left cheek to the man who strikes you on 
the right. When you see man as God, everything, even the tiger, 
will be welcome. 
 
Whatever comes to you is but the Lord, the Eternal, the Blessed 
One, appearing to us in various forms, as our father, and mother, 
and friend, and child — they are our own soul playing with us. 
As our human relationships can thus be made divine, so our 
relationship with God may take any of these forms and we can 


 
 
47 
 
look upon Him as our father, or mother, or friend, or beloved. 
Calling God Mother is a higher ideal than calling Him Father; 
and to call Him Friend is still higher; but the highest is to regard 
Him as the Beloved. The highest point of all is to see no 
difference between lover and beloved. You may remember, 
perhaps, the old Persian story, of how a lover came and knocked 
at the door of the beloved and was asked, "Who are you?" He 
answered, "It is I", and there was no response. A second time he 
came, and exclaimed, "I am here", but the door was not opened. 
The third time he came, and the voice asked from inside, "Who 
is there?" He replied "I am thyself, my beloved", and the door 
opened. So is the relation between God and ourselves. He is in 
everything, He is everything.  
 
Every man and woman is the palpable, blissful, living God. Who 
says God is unknown? Who says He is to be searched after? We 
have found God eternally. We have been living in Him 
eternally; everywhere He is eternally known, eternally 
worshipped. Then comes another idea, that other forms of 
worship are not errors. This is one of the great points to be 
remembered, that those who worship God through ceremonials 
and forms, however crude we may think them to be, are not in 
error. 
 
It is the journey from truth to truth, from lower truth to higher 
truth. Darkness is less light; evil is less good; impurity is less 
purity. It must always be borne in mind that we should see others 
with eyes of love, with sympathy, knowing that they are going 


 
 
48 
 
along the same path that we have trodden. If you are free, you 
must know that all will be so sooner or later, and if you are free, 
how can you see the impermanent? If you are really pure, how 
do you see the impure? For what is within, is without.  
 
We cannot see impurity without having it inside ourselves. This 
is one of the practical sides of Vedanta, and I hope that we shall 
all try to carry it into our lives. Our whole life here is to carry 
this into practice, but the one great point we gain is that we shall 
work with satisfaction and contentment, instead of with 
discontent and dissatisfaction, for we know that Truth is within 
us, we have It as our birthright, and we have only to manifest It, 
and make It tangible.

Part - 3 
(Delivered in London, 17th November 1896) 
 
In the Chhâdogya Upanishad we read that a sage called Nârada 
came to another called Sanatkumâra, and asked him various 
questions, of which one was, if religion was the cause of things 
as they are. And Sanatkumara leads him, as it were, step by step, 
telling him that there is something higher than this earth, and 
something higher than that, and so on, till he comes to Âkâsha, 
ether. Ether is higher than light, because in the ether are the sun 
and the moon, lightning and the stars; in ether we live, and in 
ether we die.  
 
Then the question arises, if there is anything higher than that, 
and Sanatkumara tells him of Prâna. This Prana, according to 
the Vedanta, is the principle of life. It is like ether, an 
omnipresent principle; and all motion, either in the body or 
anywhere else, is the work of this Prana. It is greater than 
Akasha, and through it everything lives. Prana is in the mother, 
in the father, in the sister, in the teacher, Prana is the knower. I 
will read another passage, where Shvetaketu asks his father 
about the Truth, and the father teaches him different things, and 
concludes by saying, "That which is the fine cause in all these 
things, of It are all these things made.  
 
 


 
 
50 
 
That is the All, that is Truth, thou art That, O Shvetaketu." And 
then he gives various examples. "As a bee, O Shvetaketu, 
gathers honey from different flowers, and as the different 
honeys do not know that they are from various trees, and from 
various flowers, so all of us, having come to that Existence, 
know not that we have done so. Now, that  which is that subtle 
essence, in It all that exists has its self. It is the True. It is the Self 
and thou, O Shvetaketu, are That." He gives another example of 
the rivers running down to the ocean. "As the rivers, when they 
are in the ocean, do not know that they have been various rivers, 
even so when we come out of that Existence, we do not know 
that we are That. O Shvetaketu, thou art That." So on he goes 
with his teachings. 
 
Now there are two principles of knowledge. The one principle 
is that we know by referring the particular to the general, and 
the general to the universal; and the second is that anything of 
which the explanation is sought is to be explained so far as 
possible from its own nature. Taking up the first principle, we 
see that all our knowledge really consists of classifications, 
going higher and higher. When something happens singly, we 
are, as it were, dissatisfied. When it can be shown that the same 
thing happens again and again, we are satisfied and call it law. 
When we find that one apple falls, we are dissatisfied; but when 
we find that all apples fall, we call it the law of gravitation and 
are satisfied.  
 
 


 
 
51 
 
The fact is that from the particular we deduce the general. When 
we want to study religion, we should apply this scientific 
process. The same principle also holds good here, and as a fact 
we find that that has been the method all through. In reading 
these books from which I have been translating to you, the 
earliest idea that I can trace is this principle of going from the 
particular to the general. We see how the "bright ones" became 
merged into one principle; and likewise in the ideas of the 
cosmos we find the ancient thinkers going higher and higher — 
from the fine elements they go to finer and more embracing 
elements, and from these particulars they come to one 
omnipresent ether, and from that even they go to an all 
embracing force, or Prana; and through all this runs the 
principle, that one is not separate from the others.  
 
It is the very ether that exists in the higher form of Prana, or the 
higher form of Prana concretes, so to say, and becomes ether; 
and that ether becomes still grosser, and so on. The 
generalization of the Personal God is another case in point. We 
have seen how this generalization was reached, and was called 
the sum total of all consciousness. But a difficulty arises — it is 
an incomplete generalization. We take up only one side of the 
facts of nature, the fact of consciousness, and upon that we 
generalize, but the other side is left out. So, in the first place it 
is a defective generalization. There is another insufficiency, and 
that relates to the second principle.  
 
 


 
 
52 
 
Everything should be explained from its own nature. There may 
have been people who thought that every apple that fell to the 
ground was dragged down by a ghost, but the explanation is the 
law of gravitation; and although we know it is not a perfect 
explanation, yet it is much better than the other, because it is 
derived from the nature of the thing itself, while the other posits 
an extraneous cause. So, throughout the whole range of our 
knowledge; the explanation which is based upon the nature of 
the thing itself; is a scientific explanation, and an explanation 
which brings in an outside agent is unscientific. 
 
So, the explanation of a Personal God as the creator of the 
universe has to stand that test. If that God is outside of nature, 
having nothing to do with nature, and this nature is the outcome 
of the command of that God and produced from nothing, it is a 
very unscientific theory, and this has been the weak point of 
every Theistic religion throughout the ages. 
 
These two defects we find in what is generally called the theory 
of monotheism, the theory of a Personal God, with all the 
qualities of a human being multiplied very much, who, by His 
will, created this universe out of nothing and yet is separate from 
it. This leads us into two difficulties. As we have seen, it is not a 
sufficient generalization, and secondly, it is not an explanation 
of nature from nature. It holds that the effect is
 not the cause, that 
the cause is entirely separate from the effect. Yet all human 
knowledge shows that the effect is but the cause in another form. 
To this idea the discoveries of modern science are tending every 


 
 
53 
 
day, and the latest theory that has been accepted on all sides is 
the theory of evolution, the principle of which is that the effect 
is but the cause in another form, a readjustment of the cause, and 
the cause takes the form of the effect. The theory of creation out 
of nothing would be laughed at by modern scientists. Now, can 
religion stand these tests? If there be any religious theories 
which can stand these two tests, they will be acceptable to the 
modern mind, to the thinking mind. Any other theory which we 
ask the modern man to believe, on the authority of priests, or 
churches, or books, he is unable to accept, and the result is a 
hideous mass of unbelief. 
 
Even in those in whom there is an external display of belief, in 
their hearts there is a tremendous amount of unbelief. The rest 
shrink away from religion, as it were, give it up, regarding it as 
priestcraft only. Religion has been reduced to a sort of national 
form. It is one of our very best social remnants; let it remain. 
But the real necessity which the grandfather of the modern man 
felt for it is gone; he no longer finds it satisfactory to his reason. 
The idea of such a Personal God, and such a creation, the idea 
which is generally known as monotheism in every religion, 
cannot hold its own any longer. In India, it could not hold its 
own because of the Buddhists, and that was the very point where 
they gained their victory in ancient times. They showed that if 
we allow that nature is possessed of infinite power, and that 
nature can work out all its wants, it is simply unnecessary to 
insist that there is something besides nature. 
 


 
 
54 
 
Even the soul is unnecessary. The discussion about substance 
and qualities is very old, and you will sometimes find that the 
old superstition lives even at the present day. Most of you have 
read how, during the Middle Ages, and, I am sorry to say, e ven 
much later, this was one of the subjects of discussion, whether 
qualities adhered to substance, whether length, breadth, and 
thickness adhered to the substance which we call dead matter, 
whether, the substance remaining, the qualities are there or not. 
To this our Buddhist says, "You have no ground for maintaining 
the existence of such a substance; the qualities are all that exist; 
you do not see beyond them."  
 
This is just the position of most of our modern agnostics. For it 
is this fight of the substance and qualities that, on a higher plane, 
takes the form of the fight between noumenon and phenomenon. 
There is the phenomenal world, the universe of continuous 
change, and there is something behind which does not change; 
and this duality of existence, noumenon and phenomenon, some 
hold, is true, and others with better reason claim that you have 
no right to admit the two, for what we see, feel, and think is only 
the phenomenon. You have no right to assert there is anything 
beyond phenomenon; and there is no answer to this. The only 
answer we get is from the monistic theory of the Vedanta. It is 
true that only one exists, and that one is either phenomenon or 
noumenon. It is not true that there are two — something 
changing, and, in and through that, something which does not 
change; but it is the one and the same thing which appears as 
changing, and which is in reality unchangeable. 


 
 
55 
 
 
We have come to think of the body, and mind, and soul as many, 
but really there is only one; and that one is appearing in all these 
various forms. Take the well- known illustration of the monists, 
the rope appearing as the snake. Some people, in the dark or 
through some other cause, mistake the rope for the snake, but 
when knowledge comes, the snake vanishes and it is found to be 
a rope. By this illustration we see that when the snake exists in 
the mind, the rope has vanished, and when the rope exists, the 
snake has gone. When we see phenomenon, and phenomenon 
only, around us, the noumenon has vanished, but 
when we see the noumenon, the unchangeable, it naturally 
follows that the phenomenon has vanished. Now, we understand 
better the position of both the realist and the idealist. The realist 
sees the phenomenon only, and the idealist looks to the 
noumenon.  
 
For the idealist, the really genuine idealist, who has truly arrived 
at the power of perception, whereby he can get away from all 
ideas of change, for him the changeful universe has vanished, 
and he has the right to say it is all delusion, there is no change. 
The realist at the same time looks at the changeful. For him the 
unchangeable has vanished, and he has a right to say this is all 
real. What is the outcome of this philosophy? It is that the idea 
of Personal God is not sufficient. We have to get to something 
higher, to the Impersonal idea. It is the only logical step that we 
can take. 
 


 
 
56 
 
Not that the personal idea would be destroyed by that, not that 
we supply proof that the Personal God does not exist, but we 
must go to the Impersonal for the explanation of the personal, 
for the Impersonal is a much higher generalization than the 
personal. The Impersonal only can be Infinite, the personal is 
limited. Thus, we preserve the personal and do not destroy it. 
 
Often the doubt comes to us that if we arrive at the idea of the 
Impersonal God, the personal will be destroyed, if we arrive at 
the idea of the Impersonal man, the personal will be lost. But 
the Vedantic idea is not the destruction of the individual, but its 
real preservation. We cannot prove the individual by any other 
means but by referring to the universal, by proving that this 
individual is really the universal. If we think of the individual as 
separate from everything else in the universe, it cannot stand a 
minute. Such a thing never existed. 
 
Secondly, by the application of the second principle, that the 
explanation of everything must come out of the nature of the 
thing, we are led to a still bolder idea, and one more difficult to 
understand. It is nothing less than this, that the Impersonal 
Being, our highest generalization, is in ourselves, and we are 
That. "O Shvetaketu, thou art That." You are that Impersonal 
Being; that God for whom you have been searching all over the 
universe is all the time yourself — yourself not in the personal 
sense but in the Impersonal. The man we know now, the 
manifested, is personalised, but the reality of this is the 
Impersonal. To understand the personal, we have to refer it to 


 
 
57 
 
the Impersonal, the particular; must be referred to; the general, 
and that Impersonal is the Truth, the Self of man. There will be 
various questions in connection with this, and I shall try to 
answer them as we go on. Many difficulties will arise, but first 
let us clearly understand the position of monism. As manifested 
beings we appear to be separate, but our reality is one, and the 
less we think of ourselves as separate from that One, the better 
for us. The more we think of ourselves as separate from the 
Whole, the more miserable we become. 
 
From this monistic principle we get at the basis of ethics, and I 
venture to say that we cannot get any ethics from anywhere else. 
We know that the oldest idea of ethics was the will of some 
particular being or beings, but few are ready to accept that now, 
because it would be only a partial generalization. 
 
The Hindus say we must not do this or that because the Vedas 
say so, but the Christian is not going to obey the authority of the 
Vedas. The Christian says you must do this and not do that 
because the Bible says so. That will not be binding on those who 
do not believe in the Bible. But we must have a theory which is 
large enough to take in all these various grounds. 
 
Just as there are millions of people who are ready to believe in 
a Personal Creator, there have also been thousands of the 
brightest minds in this world who felt that such ideas were not 
sufficient for them, and wanted something higher, and wherever 
religion was not broad enough to include all these minds, the 


 
 
58 
 
result was that the brightest minds in society were always 
outside of religion; and never was this so marked as at the present 
time, especially in Europe.  
 
To include these minds, therefore, religion must become broad 
enough. Everything it claims must be judged from the 
standpoint of reason. Why religions should claim that they are 
not bound to abide by the standpoint of reason, no one knows. 
If one does not take the standard of reason, there cannot be any 
true judgement, even in the case of religions. One religion may 
ordain something very hideous. 
 
For instance, the Mohammedan religion allows Mohammedans 
to kill all who are not of their religion. It is clearly stated in the 
Koran, "Kill the infidels if they do not become Mohammedans." 
They must be put to fire and sword. Now if we tell a 
Mohammedan that this is wrong, he will naturally ask, "How do 
you know that? How do you know it is not good? My book says 
it is." If you say your book is older, there will come the Buddhist, 
and say, my book is much older still. Then will come the Hindu, 
and say, my books are the oldest of all. Therefore, referring to 
books will not do.  
 
Where is the standard by which you can compare? You will say, 
look at the Sermon on the Mount, and the Mohammedan will 
reply, look at the Ethics of the Koran. The Mohammedan will 
say, who is the arbiter as to which is the better of the two? 
Neither the New Testament nor the Koran can be the arbiter in 


 
 
59 
 
a quarrel between them. There must be some independent 
authority, and that cannot be any book, but something which is 
universal; and what is more universal than reason? It has been 
said that reason is not strong enough; it does not always
 help us 
to get at the Truth; many times, it makes mistakes, and, 
therefore, the conclusion is that we must believe in the authority 
of a church! That was said to me by a Roman Catholic, but I 
could not see the logic of it. On the other hand I should say, if 
reason be so weak, a body of priests would be weaker, and I am 
not going to accept their verdict, but I will abide by my reason, 
because with all its weakness there is some chance of my getting 
at truth through it; while, by the other means, there is no such 
hope at all. We should, therefore, follow reason and also 
sympathise with those who do not come to any sort of belief, 
following reason. 
 
For it is better that mankind should become atheist by following 
reason than blindly believe in two hundred million of gods on 
the authority of anybody. What we want is progress, 
development, realisation. No theories ever made men higher. No 
amount of books can help us to become purer. The only power 
is in realisation, and that lies in ourselves and comes from 
thinking. Let men think. A clod of earth never thinks; but it 
remains only a lump of earth. The glory of man is that he is a 
thinking being. It is the nature of man to think and therein he 
differs from animals. I believe in reason and follow reason 
having seen enough of the evils of authority, for I was born in a 
country where they have gone to the extreme of authority.

The Hindus believe that creation has come out of the Vedas. 
How do you know there is a cow? Because the word cow is in 
the Vedas. How do you know there is a man outside? Because 
the word man is there. If it had not been, there would have been 
no man outside. That is what they say. Authority with a 
vengeance! And it is not studied as I have studied it, but some 
of the most powerful minds have taken it up and spun out 
wonderful logical theories round it. They have reasoned it out, 
and there it stands — a whole system of philosophy; and 
thousands of the brightest intellects hare been dedicated through 
thousands of years to the working out of this theory. Such has 
been the power of authority, and great are the dangers thereof. 
It stunts the growth of humanity, and we must not forget that we 
want growth. Even in all relative truth, more than the truth itself, 
we want the exercise.  
 
That is our life. The monistic theory has this merit that it is the 
most rational of all the religious theories that we can conceive 
of. Every other theory, every conception of God which is partial 
and little and personal is not rational. And yet monism has this 
grandeur that it embraces all these partial conceptions of God 
as being necessary for many. Some people say that this personal 
explanation is irrational. But it is consoling; they want a 
consoling religion and we understand that it is necessary for 
them. The clear light of truth very few in this life can bear, much 
less live up to. It is necessary, therefore, that this comfortable 
religion should exist; it helps many souls to a better one. Small 


 
 
61 
 
minds whose circumference is very limited and which require 
little things to build them up, never venture to soar high in 
thought. Their conceptions are very good and helpful to them, 
even if only of little gods and symbols.  
 
But you have to understand the Impersonal, for it is in and 
through that alone that these others can be explained. Take, for 
instance, the idea of a Personal God. A man who understands 
and believes in the Impersonal — John Stuart Mill, for example 
— may say that a Personal God is impossible, and cannot be 
proved. I admit with him that a Personal God cannot be 
demonstrated. But He is the highest reading of the Impersonal 
that can be reached by the human intellect, and what else is the 
universe but various readings of the Absolute?It is like a book 
before us, and each one has brought his intellect to read it, and 
each one has to read it for himself. 
 
There is something which is common in the intellect of all men; 
therefore, certain things appear to be the same to the intellect of 
mankind. That you and I see a chair proves that there is 
something common to both our minds. Suppose a being comes 
with another sense, he will not see the chair at all; but all beings 
similarly constituted will see the same things.Thus, this universe 
itself is the Absolute, the unchangeable, the noumenon; and the 
phenomenon constitutes the reading thereof. For you will first 
find that all phenomena are finite. 
 
 


 
 
62 
 
Every phenomenon that we can see, feel, or think of, is finite, 
limited by our knowledge, and the Personal God as we conceive 
of Him is in fact a phenomenon. The very idea of causation 
exists only in the phenomenal world, and God as the cause of 
this universe must naturally be thought of as limited, and yet He 
is the same Impersonal God. 
 
This very universe, as we have seen, is the same Impersonal 
Being read by our intellect. Whatever is reality in the universe 
is that Impersonal Being, and the forms and conceptions are 
given to it by our intellects. Whatever is real in this table is that 
Being, and the table form and all other forms are given by our 
intellects. Now, motion, for instance, which is a necessary 
adjunct of the phenomenal, cannot be predicated of the 
Universal. Every little bit, every atom inside the universe, is in 
a constant state of change and motion, but the universe as a 
whole is unchangeable, because motion or change is a relative 
thing; we can only think of something in motion in comparison 
with something which is not moving. 
 
There must be two things in order to understand motion. The 
whole mass of the universe, taken as a unit, cannot move. In 
regard to what will it move? It cannot be said to change. With 
regard to what will it change? So the whole is the Absolute; but 
within it every particle is in a constant state of flux and change.  
 
It is unchangeable and changeable at the same time, Impersonal 
and Personal in one. This is our conception of the universe, of 


 
 
63 
 
motion and of God, and that is what is meant by "Thou art That". 
Thus we see that the Impersonal instead of doing away with the 
personal, the Absolute instead of pulling down the relative, only 
explains it to the full satisfaction of our reason and heart. 
 
The Personal God and all that exists in the universe are the same 
Impersonal Being seen through our minds. When we shall be rid 
of our minds, our little personalities, we shall become one with 
It. This is what is meant by "Thou art That".  
 
For we must know our true nature, the Absolute. The finite, 
manifested man forgets his source and thinks himself to be 
entirely separate. We, as personalised, differentiated beings, 
forget our reality, and the teaching of monism is not that we 
shall give up these differentiations, but we must learn to 
understand what they are. We are in reality that Infinite Being, 
and our personalities represent so many channels through which 
this Infinite Reality is manifesting Itself; and the whole mass of 
changes which we call evolution is brought about by the soul 
trying to manifest more and more of its infinite energy. We 
cannot stop anywhere on this side of the Infinite; our power, and 
blessedness, and wisdom, cannot but grow into the Infinite. 
Infinite power and existence and blessedness are ours, and we 
have not to acquire them; they are our own, and we have only to 
manifest them. This is the central idea of monism, and one that 
is so hard to understand.

From my childhood everyone around me taught weakness; I 
have been told ever since I was born that I was a weak thing. It 
is very difficult for me now to realise my own strength, but by 
analysis and reasoning I gain knowledge of my own strength, I 
realise it. All the knowledge that we have in this world, where 
did it come from? It was within us. What knowledge is outside? 
None. Knowledge was not in matter; it was in man all the time.  
 
Nobody ever created knowledge; man brings it from within. It 
is lying there. The whole of that big banyan tree which covers 
acres of ground, was in the little seed which was, perhaps, no 
bigger than one eighth of a mustard seed; all that mass of energy 
was there confined. The gigantic intellect, we know, lies coiled 
up in the protoplasmic cell, and why should not the infinite 
energy? We know that it is so. It may seem like a paradox, but 
is true. Each one of us has come out of one protoplasmic cell, 
and all the powers we possess were coiled up there. You cannot 
say they came from food; for if you heap up food mountains 
high, what power comes out of it? The energy was there, 
potentially no doubt, but still there. So is infinite power in the 
soul of man, whether he knows it or not.Its manifestation is only 
a question of being conscious of it. Slowly this infinite giant is, 
as it were, waking up, becoming conscious of his power, and 
arousing himself; and with his growing consciousness, more and 
more of his bonds are breaking, chains are bursting asunder, and 
the day is sure to come when, with the full consciousness of his 
infinite power and wisdom, the giant will rise to his feet and 
stand erect. Let us all help to hasten that glorious consummation.

Part - 4 
(Delivered in London, 18th November 1896) 
We have been dealing more with the universal so far. This 
morning, I shall try to place before you the Vedantic ideas of the 
relation of the particular to the universal. As we have seen, in 
the dualistic form of Vedic doctrines, the earlier forms, there was 
a clearly defined particular and limited soul for every being. 
There have been a great many theories about this particular soul 
in each individual, but the main discussion was between the 
ancient Vedantists and the ancient Buddhists, the former 
believing in the individual soul as complete in itself, the latter 
denying in toto the existence of such an individual soul.  
As I told you the other day, it is pretty much the same discussion 
you have in Europe as to substance and quality, one set holding 
that behind the qualities there is something as substance, in 
which the qualities in here; and the other denying the existence 
of such a substance as being unnecessary, for the qualities may 
live by themselves. The most ancient theory of the soul, of 
course, is based upon the argument of self-identity— "I am I" 
— that the I of yesterday is the I of today, and the I of today will 
be the I of tomorrow; that in spite of all the changes that are 
happening to the body, I yet believe that I am the same I. This 
seems to have been the central argument with those who 
believed in a limited, and yet perfectly complete, individual 
soul. 


 
 
66 
 
 On the other hand, the ancient Buddhists denied the necessity 
of such an assumption. They brought forward the argument that 
all that we know, and all that we possibly can know, are simply 
these changes. The positing of an unchangeable and unchanging 
substance is simply superfluous, and even if there were any such 
unchangeable thing, we could never understand it, nor should 
we ever be able to cognise it in any sense of the word. The same 
discussion you will find at the present time going on in Europe 
between the religionists and the idealists on the one side, and 
the modern positivists and agnostics on the other; one set 
believing there is something which does not change (of whom 
the latest representative is your Herbert Spencer), that we catch 
a glimpse of something which is unchangeable. And the other is 
represented by the modern Comtists and modern Agnostics.  
Those of you who were interested a few years ago in the 
discussions between Herbert Spencer and Frederick Harrison 
might have noticed that it was the same old difficulty, the one 
party standing for a substance behind the changeful, and the 
other party denying the necessity for such an assumption. One 
party says we cannot conceive of changes without conceiving of 
something which does not change; the other party brings out the 
argument that this is superfluous; we can only conceive of 
something which is changing, and as to the unchanging, we can 
neither know, feel, nor sense it. 
 In India this great question did not find its solution in very 
ancient times, because we have seen that the assumption of a 
substance which is behind the qualities, and which is not the 


 
 
67 
 
qualities, can never be substantiated; nay, even the argument 
from self- identity, from memory, — that I am the I of yesterday 
because I remember it, and therefore I have been a continuous 
something — cannot be substantiated. The other quibble that is 
generally put forward is a mere delusion of words. For instance, 
a man may take a long series of such sentences as "I do", "I go", 
"I dream", "I sleep", "I move", and here you will find it claimed 
that the doing, going, dreaming etc., have been changing, but 
what remained constant was that "I".  
As such they conclude that the "I" is something which is 
constant and an individual in itself, but all these changes belong 
to the body. This, though apparently very convincing
 and clear, 
is based upon the mere play on words. The "I" and the doing, 
going, and dreaming may be separate in black and white, but no 
one can separate them in his mind. When I eat, I think of myself 
as eating — I am identified with eating. When I run, I and the 
running are not two separate things. Thus the argument from 
personal identity does not seem to be very strong. The other 
argument from memory is also weak.  
If the identity of my being is represented by my memory, many 
things which I have forgotten are lost from that identity. And we 
know that people under certain conditions forget their whole 
past. In many cases of lunacy, a man will think of himself as 
made of glass, or as being an animal. If the existence of that man 
depends on memory, he has become glass, which not being the 
case we cannot make the identity of the Self depend on such a 
flimsy substance as memory. Thus, we see that the soul as a 


 
 
68 
 
limited yet complete and continuing identity cannot be 
established as separate from the qualities. 
 
We cannot establish a narrowed-down, limited existence to 
which is attached a bunch of qualities. On the other hand, the 
argument of the ancient Buddhists seems to be stronger that  —  
we do not know, and cannot know, anything that is beyond the 
bunch of qualities. According to them, the soul consists of a 
bundle of qualities called sensations and feelings. A mass of 
such is what is called the soul, and this mass is continually 
changing. The Advaitist theory of the soul reconciles both these 
positions. The position of the Advaitist is that it is true that we 
cannot think of the substance as separate from the qualities, we 
cannot think of change and not-change at the same time; it 
would be impossible. But the very thing which is the substance 
is the quality; substance and quality are not two things. It is the 
unchangeable that is appearing as the changeable.  
 
The unchangeable substance of the universe is not something 
separate from it. The noumenon is not something different from 
the phenomena, but it is the very noumenon which has become 
the phenomena. There is a soul which is unchanging, and what 
we call feelings and perceptions, nay, even the body, are the 
very soul, seen from another point of view. We have got into the 
habit of thinking that we have bodies and souls and so forth, but 
really speaking, there is only one.  
 
 


 
 
69 
 
When I think of myself as the body, I am only a body; it is 
meaningless to say I am something else. And when I think of 
myself as the soul, the body vanishes, and the perception of the 
body does not remain. None can get the perception of the Self 
without his perception of the body having vanished, none can 
get perception of the substance without his perception of the 
qualities having vanished. The ancient illustration of Advaita, 
of the rope being taken for a snake, may elucidate the point a 
little more. When a man mistakes the rope for a snake, the rope 
has vanished, and when he takes it for a rope, the snake has 
vanished, and the rope only remains. The ideas of dual or treble 
existence come from reasoning on insufficient data, and we read 
them in books or hear about them, until we come under the 
delusion that we really have a dual perception of the soul and the 
body; but such a perception never really exists. 
 
The perception is either of the body or of the soul. It requires no 
arguments to prove it, you can verify it in your own minds. Try 
to think of yourself as a soul, as a disembodied something. You 
will find it to be almost impossible, and those few who are able 
to do so will find that at the time when they realise themselves 
as a soul, they have no idea of the body. You have heard of, or 
perhaps have seen, persons who on particular occasions had 
been in peculiar states of mind, brought about by deep 
meditation, self-hypnotism, hysteria, or drugs. From their 
experience you may gather that when they were perceiving the 
internal something, the external had vanished for them. This 
shows that whatever exists is one. That one is appearing in these 


 
 
70 
 
various forms, and all these various forms give rise to the 
relation of cause and effect.  
 
The relation of cause and effect is one of evolution — the one 
becomes the other, and so on. Sometimes the cause vanishes, as 
it were, and in its place leaves the effect. If the soul is the cause 
of the body, the soul, as it were, vanishes for the time being, and 
the body remains; and when the body vanishes, the soul 
remains. This theory fits the arguments of the Buddhists that 
were levelled against the assumption of the dualism of body and 
soul, by denying the duality, and showing that the substance and 
the qualities are one and the same thing appearing in various 
forms.  
 
We have seen also that this idea of the unchangeable can be 
established only as regards the whole, but never as regards the 
part. 
 
The very idea of part comes from the idea of change or motion. 
Everything that is limited we can understand and know, because 
it is changeable; and the whole must be unchangeable, because 
there is no other thing besides it in relation to which change 
would be possible. Change is always in regard to something 
which does not change, or which changes relatively less. 
According to Advaita, therefore, the idea of the soul as 
universal, unchangeable, and immortal can be demonstrated as 
far as possible. 
 


 
 
71 
 
 
The difficulty would be as regards the particular. What shall we 
do with the old dualistic theories which have such a hold upon 
us, and which we have all to pass through — these beliefs in 
limited, little, individual souls? We have seen that we are 
immortal with regard to the whole; but the difficulty is, we 
desire so much to be immortal as parts of the whole. We have 
seen that we are Infinite, and that that is our real individuality. 
But we want so much to make these little souls individual. What 
becomes of them when we find in our everyday experience that 
these little souls are individuals, with only this reservation that 
they are continuously growing individuals? They are the same, 
yet not the same.  
 
The ‘I’ of yesterday is the ‘I’ of today, and yet not so, it is 
changed somewhat. Now, by getting rid of the dualistic 
conception, that in the midst of all these changes there is 
something that does not change, and taking the most modern of 
conceptions, that of evolution, we find that the "I" is a 
continuously changing, expanding entity. If it be true that man 
is the evolution of a mollusc, the mollusc individual is the same 
as the man, only it has to become expanded a great deal. From 
mollusc to man, it has been a continuous expansion towards 
infinity. 
 
Therefore the limited soul can be styled an individual which is 
continuously expanding towards the Infinite Individual. Perfect 
individuality will only be reached when it has reached the 


 
 
72 
 
Infinite, but on this side of the Infinite it is a continuously 
changing, growing personality. One of the remarkable features 
of the Advaitist system of Vedanta is to harmonise the preceding 
systems. In many cases it helped the philosophy very much; in 
some cases it hurt it. Our ancient philosophers knew what you 
call the theory of evolution; that growth is gradual, step by step, 
and the recognition of this led them to harmonise all the 
preceding systems. 
 
Thus, not one of these preceding ideas was rejected. The fault 
of the Buddhistic faith was that it had neither the faculty nor the 
perception of this continual, expansive growth, and for this 
reason it never even made an attempt to harmonise itself with 
the preexisting steps towards the ideal. They were rejected as 
useless and harmful. 
 
This tendency in religion is most harmful. A man gets a new and 
better idea, and then he looks back on those he has given up, and 
forthwith decides that they were mischievous and unnecessary. 
He never thinks that, however crude they may appear from his 
present point of view, they were very useful to him, that they 
were necessary for him to reach his present state, and that 
everyone of us has to grow in a similar fashion, living first on 
crude ideas, taking benefit from them, and then arriving at a 
higher standard. With the oldest theories, therefore, the Advaita 
is friendly. 
 
 


 
 
73 
 
Dualism and all systems that had preceded it are accepted by the 
Advaita not in a patronising way, but with the conviction that 
they are true manifestations of the same truth, and that they all 
lead to the same conclusions as the Advaita has reached.  
 
With blessing, and not with cursing, should be preserved all 
these various steps through which humanity has to pass. 
Therefore, all these dualistic systems have never been rejected 
or thrown out, but have been kept intact in the Vedanta; and the 
dualistic conception of an individual soul, limited yet complete 
in itself, finds its place in the Vedanta. According to dualism, 
man dies and goes to other worlds, and so forth; and these ideas 
are kept in the Vedanta in their entirety. For with the recognition 
of growth in the Advaitist system, these theories are given their 
proper place by admitting that they represent only a partial view 
of the Truth. From the dualistic standpoint this universe can only 
be looked upon as a creation of matter or force, can only be 
looked upon as the play of a certain will, and that will again can 
only be looked upon as separate from the universe. 
 
Thus, a man from such a standpoint has to see himself as 
composed of a dual nature, body and soul, and this soul, though 
limited, is individually complete in itself. Such a man's ideas of 
immortality and of the future life would necessarily accord with 
his idea of soul. These phases have been kept in the Vedanta, 
and it is, therefore, necessary for me to present to you a few of 
the popular ideas of dualism. According to this
 theory, we have 
a body, of course, and behind the body there is what they call a 


 
 
74 
 
fine body. This fine body is also made of matter, only very fine. 
It is the receptacle of all our Karma, of all our actions and 
impressions, which are ready to spring up into visible forms. 
Every thought that we think, every deed that we do, after a 
certain time becomes fine, goes into seed form, so to speak, and 
lives in the fine body in a potential form, and after a time it 
emerges again and bears its results. 
 
These results condition the life of man. Thus, he moulds his own 
life. Man is not bound by any other laws excepting those which 
he makes for himself. Our thoughts, our words and deeds are the 
threads of the net which we throw round ourselves, for good or 
for evil. Once we set in motion a certain power, we have to take 
the full consequences of it. This is the law of Karma. Behind the 
subtle body, lives Jiva or the individual soul of man. There are 
various discussions about the form and the size of this individual 
soul. According to some, it is very small like an atom; according 
to others, it is not so small as that; according to others, it is very 
big, and so on. This Jiva is a part of that universal substance, 
and it is also eternal; without beginning it is existing, and 
without end it will exist. It is passing through all these forms in 
order to manifest its real nature which is purity. Every action 
that retards this manifestation is called an evil action, so with 
thoughts.  
 
And every action and every thought that helps the Jiva to expand, 
to manifest its real nature, is good. One theory that is held in 
common in India by the crudest dualists as well as by the most 


 
 
75 
 
advanced non-dualists is that all the possibilities and powers of 
the soul are within it, and do not come from any external source. 
They are in the soul in potential form, and the whole work of 
life is simply directed towards manifesting those potentialities.  
 
They have also the theory of reincarnation which says that after 
the dissolution of this body, the Jiva will have another, and after 
that has been dissolved, it will again have another, and so on, 
either here or in some other worlds; but this world is given the 
preference, as it is considered the best of all worlds for our 
purpose. Other worlds are conceived of as worlds where there is 
very little misery, but for that very reason, they argue, there is 
less chance of thinking of higher things there. As this world 
contains some happiness and a good deal of misery, the Jiva 
some time or other gets awakened, as it were, and thinks of 
freeing itself. But just as very rich persons in this world have the 
least chance of thinking of higher things, so the Jiva in heaven 
has little chance of progress, for its condition is the same as that 
of a rich man, only more intensified; it has a very fine body 
which knows no disease, and is under no necessity of eating or 
drinking, and all its desires are fulfilled. The Jiva lives there, 
having enjoyment after enjoyment, and so forgets all about its 
real nature. Still there are some higher worlds, where in spite of 
all enjoyments, its further evolution is possible. Some dualists 
conceive of the goal as the highest heaven, where souls will live 
with God for ever. 
 
 


 
 
76 
 
They will have beautiful bodies and will know neither disease 
nor death, nor any other evil, and all their desires will be 
fulfilled. From time to time some of them will come back to this 
earth and take another body to teach human beings the way to 
God; and the great teachers of the world have been such. They 
were already free, and were living with God in the highest 
sphere; but their love and sympathy for suffering humanity was 
so great that they came and incarnated again to teach mankind 
the way to heaven. Of course, we know that the Advaita holds 
that this cannot be the goal or the ideal; bodilessness must be 
the ideal. The ideal cannot be finite. 
 
Anything short of the Infinite cannot be the ideal, and there 
cannot be an infinite body. That would be impossible, as body 
comes from limitation. There cannot be infinite thought,
 because 
thought comes from limitation. We have to go beyond the body, 
and beyond thought too, says the Advaita. 
 
And we have also seen that, according to Advaita, this freedom 
is not to be attained, it is already ours. We only forget it and 
deny it. Perfection is not to be attained, it is already within us. 
Immortality and bliss are not to be acquired, we possess them 
already; they have been ours all the time. If you dare declare that 
you are free, free you are this moment. If you say you are bound, 
bound you will remain. This is what Advaita boldly declares. I 
have told you the ideas of the dualists. You can take whichever 
you like. The highest ideal of the Vedanta is very difficult to 
understand, and people are always quarrelling about it, and the 


 
 
77 
 
greatest difficulty is that when they get hold of certain ideas, 
they deny and fight other ideas.  
 
Take up what suits you, and let others take up what they need. If 
you are desirous of clinging to this little individuality, to this 
limited manhood, remain in it, have all these desires, and be 
content and pleased with them. If your experience of manhood 
has been very good and nice, retain it as long as you like; and you 
can do so, for you are the makers of your own fortunes; none can 
compel you to give up your manhood. You will be men as long 
as you like; none can prevent you. If you want to be angels, you 
will be angels, that is the law. But there may be others who do 
not want to be angels even. What right have you to think that 
theirs is a horrible notion? You may be frightened to lose a 
hundred pounds, but there may be others who would not even 
wink if they lost all the money they had in the world. There have 
been such men and still there are. Why do you dare to judge them 
according to your standard? You cling on to your limitations, and 
these little worldly ideas may be your highest ideal. You are 
welcome to them. It will be to you as you wish. 
 
But there are others who have seen the truth and cannot rest in 
these limitations, who have done with these things and want to 
get beyond. The world with all its enjoyments is a mere mud- 
puddle for them. Why do you want to bind them down to your 
ideas? You must get rid of this tendency once for all. Accord a 
place to everyone. I once read a story about some ships that were 
caught in a cyclone in the South Sea Islands, and there was a 


 
 
78 
 
picture of it in the Illustrated London News. All of them were 
wrecked except one English vessel, which weathered the storm.  
 
The picture showed the men who were going to be drowned, 
standing on the decks and cheering the people who were sailing 
through the storm (H.M.S. Calliope and the American men-of-
war at Samoa. — Ed). Be brave and generous like that. Do not 
drag others down to where you are. Another foolish notion is that 
if we lose our little individuality, there will be no morality, no 
hope for humanity.  
 
As if everybody had been dying for humanity all the time! God 
bless you! If in every country there were two hundred men and 
women really wanting to do good to humanity, the millennium 
would come in five days. We know how we are dying for 
humanity! These are all tall talks, and nothing else. The history 
of the world shows that those who never thought of their little 
individuality were the greatest benefactors of the human race, 
and that the more men and women think of themselves, the less 
are they able to do for others. One is unselfishness, and the other 
selfishness. Clinging on to little enjoyments, and to desire the 
continuation and repetition of this state of things is utter 
selfishness. It arises not from any desire for truth, its genesis is 
not in kindness for other beings, but in the utter selfishness of the 
human heart, in the idea, "I will have everything, and do not care 
for anyone else." This is as it appears to me. I would like to see 
more moral men in the world like some of those grand old 
prophets and sages of ancient times who would have given up 


 
 
79 
 
a hundred lives
 if they could by so doing benefit one little 
animal! 
 
Talk of morality and doing good to others! Silly talk of the 
present time! I would like to see moral men like Gautama 
Buddha, who did not believe in a Personal God or a personal 
soul, never asked about them, but was a perfect agnostic, and 
yet was ready to lay down his life for anyone, and worked all 
his life for the good of all, and thought only of the good of all. 
Well, it has been said by his biographer, in describing his birth, 
that he was born for the good of the many, as a blessing to the 
many. He did not go to the forest to meditate for his own 
salvation; he felt that the world was burning, and that he must 
find a way out. "Why is there so much misery in the world?” — 
was the one question that dominated his whole life. Do you 
think we are so moral as the Buddha? 
 
The more selfish a man, the more immoral he is. And so also 
with the race. That race which is bound down to itself has been 
the most cruel and the most wicked in the whole world. There 
has not been a religion that has clung to this dualism more than 
that founded by the Prophet of Arabia, and there has not been a 
religion which has shed so much blood and been so cruel to 
other men. In the Koran there is the doctrine that a man who 
does not believe these teachings should be killed; it is a mercy 
to kill him! And the surest way to get to heaven, where there are 
beautiful houris and all sorts of sense-enjoyments, is by killing 
these unbelievers. Think of the bloodshed there has been in 


 
 
80 
 
consequence of such beliefs! In the religion of Christ there was 
little of crudeness; there is very little difference between the 
pure religion of Christ and that of the Vedanta. You find there 
the idea of oneness; but Christ also preached dualistic ideas to 
the people in order to give them something tangible to take hold 
of, to lead them up to the highest ideal. 
 
The same Prophet who preached, "Our Father which art in 
heaven", also preached, "I and my Father are one", and the same 
Prophet knew that through the "Father in heaven" lies the way 
to the "I and my Father are one". There was only blessing and 
love in the religion of Christ; but as soon as crudeness crept in, 
it was degraded into something not much better than the religion 
of the Prophet of Arabia. It was crudeness indeed — this fight 
for the little self, this clinging on to the "I", not only in this life, 
but also in the desire for its continuance even after death. This 
they declare to be unselfishness; this the foundation of morality! 
Lord help us, if this be the foundation of morality! 
 
And strangely enough, men and women who ought to know 
better think all morality will be destroyed if these little selves go 
and stand aghast at the idea that morality can only stand upon 
their destruction. The watchword of all well-being, of all moral 
good is not "I" but "thou". Who cares whether there is a heaven 
or a hell, who cares if there is a soul or not, who cares if there is 
an unchangeable or not? 
 
 


 
 
81 
 
Here is the world, and it is full of misery. Go out into it as 
Buddha did, and struggle to lessen it or die in the attempt. Forget 
yourselves; this is the first lesson to be learnt, whether you are 
a theist or an atheist, whether you are an agnostic or a Vedantist, 
a Christian or a Mohammedan. The one lesson obvious to all is 
the destruction of the little self and the building up of the Real 
Self. Two forces have been working side by side in parallel 
lines. 
 
The one says "I", the other says "not I". Their manifestation is 
not only in man but in animals, not only in animals but in the 
smallest worms.  The tigress that plunges her fangs into the 
warm blood of a human being would give up her own life to 
protect her young.The most depraved man who thinks nothing 
of taking the lives of his brother men will, perhaps, sacrifice 
himself without any hesitation to save his starving wife and 
children. Thus, throughout creation these two forces are 
working side by side; where you find the one, you find the other 
too. The one is selfishness, the other is unselfishness.  
 
The one is acquisition, the other is renunciation. The one takes, 
the other gives. From the lowest to the highest, the whole 
universe is the playground of these two forces. It does not 
require any demonstration; it is obvious to all. What right has 
any section of the community to base the whole work and 
evolution of the universe upon one of these two factors alone, 
upon competition and struggle? What right has it to base the 
whole working of the universe upon passion and fight, upon 


 
 
82 
 
competition and struggle? That these exist we do not deny; but 
what right has anyone to deny the working of the other force? 
Can any man deny that love, this "not I", this renunciation is the 
only positive power in the universe? That other is only the 
misguided employment of the power of love; the power of love 
brings competition; the real genesis of competition is in love. 
The real genesis of evil is in unselfishness. The creator of evil is 
good, and the end is also good. It is only misdirection of the 
power of good. 
 
A man who murders another is, perhaps, moved to do so by the 
love of his own child. His love has become limited to that one 
little baby, to the exclusion of the millions of other human 
beings in the universe. Yet, limited or unlimited, it is the same 
love. Thus the motive power of the whole universe, in whatever 
way it manifests itself, is that one wonderful thing, 
unselfishness, renunciation, love, the real, the only living force 
in existence. 
 
Therefore, the Vedantist insists upon that oneness. We insist 
upon this explanation because we cannot admit two causes of 
the universe. If we simply hold that by limitation the same 
beautiful, wonderful love appears to be evil or vile, we find
 the 
whole universe explained by the one force of love. If not, two 
causes of the universe have to be taken for granted, one good 
and the other evil, one love and the other hatred. Which is more 
logical? Certainly, the oneforce theory. Let us now pass on to 
things which do not possibly belong to dualism. I cannot stay 


 
 
83 
 
longer with the dualists. I am afraid. My idea is to show that the 
highest ideal of morality and unselfishness goes hand in hand 
with the highest metaphysical conception, and that you need not 
lower your conception to get ethics and morality, but, on the 
other hand, to reach a real basis of morality and ethics you must 
have the highest philosophical and scientific conceptions. 
Human knowledge is not antagonistic to human well-being. On 
the contrary, it is knowledge alone that will save us in every 
department of life — in knowledge is worship. The more we 
know the better for us. The Vedantist says, the cause of all that 
is apparently evil is the limitation of the unlimited. 
 
The love which gets limited into little channels and seems to be 
evil eventually comes out at the other end and manifests itself 
as God. The Vedanta also says that the cause of all this apparent 
evil is in ourselves. Do not blame any supernatural being, 
neither be hopeless and despondent, nor think we are in a place 
from which we can never escape unless someone comes and 
lends us a helping hand. 
 
That cannot be, says the Vedanta. We are like silkworms; we 
make the thread out of our own substance and spin the cocoon, 
and in course of time are imprisoned inside. But this is not 
forever. In that cocoon we shall develop spiritual realisation, 
and like the butterfly come out free. This network of Karma we 
have woven around ourselves; and in our ignorance we feel as 
if we are bound, and weep and wail for help. But help does not 
come from without; it comes from within ourselves. Cry to all 


 
 
84 
 
the gods in the universe. I cried for years, and in the end I found 
that I was helped. But help came from within. And I had to undo 
what I had done by mistake. 
  
That is the only way. I had to cut the net which I had thrown 
round myself, and the power to do this is within. Of this I am 
certain that not one aspiration, well-guided or ill-guided in my 
life, has been in vain, but that I am the resultant of all my past, 
both good and evil. I have committed many mistakes in my life; 
but mark you, I am sure of this that without every one of those 
mistakes I should not be what I am today, and so am quite 
satisfied to have made them. I do not mean that you are to go 
home and willfully commit mistakes; do not misunderstand me 
in that way.  
 
But do not mope because of the mistakes you have committed, 
but know that in the end all will come out straight. It cannot be 
otherwise, because goodness is our nature, purity is our nature, 
and that nature can never be destroyed. Our essential nature 
always remains the same. What we are to understand is this, that 
what we call mistakes or evil, we commit because we are weak, 
and we are weak because we are ignorant. I prefer to call them 
mistakes. The word sin, although originally a very good word, 
has got a certain flavour about it that frightens me. Who makes 
us ignorant? We ourselves. We put our hands over our eyes and 
weep that it is dark. Take the hands away and there is light; the 
light exists always for us, the self-effulgent nature of the human 
soul. Do you not hear what your modern scientific men say? 


 
 
85 
 
What is the cause of evolution? Desire. The animal wants to do 
something, but does not find the environment favourable, and 
therefore develops a new body. Who develops it? The animal 
itself, its will. You have developed from the lowest amoeba. 
Continue to exercise your will and it will take you higher still. 
The will is almighty. If it is almighty, you may say, why cannot 
I do everything? But you are thinking only of your little self. 
Look back on yourselves from the state of the amoeba
 to the 
human being; who made all that? Your own will. Can you deny 
then that it is almighty? That which has made you come up so 
high can make you go higher still. What you want is character, 
strengthening of the will. If I teach you, therefore, that your 
nature is evil, that you should go home and sit in sackcloth and 
ashes and weep your lives out because you took certain false 
steps, it will not help you, but will weaken you all the more, and 
I shall be showing you the road to more evil than good. If this 
room is full of darkness for thousands of years and you come in 
and begin to weep and wail, "Oh the darkness", will the darkness 
vanish? Strike a match and light comes in a moment.  
 
What good will it do you to think all your lives, "Oh, I have done 
evil, I have made many mistakes"? It requires no ghost to tell us 
that. Bring in the light and the evil goes in a moment. Build up 
your character, and manifest your real nature, the Effulgent, the 
Resplendent, the Ever-Pure, and call It up in everyone that you 
see. I wish that everyone of us had come to such a state that even 
in the vilest of human beings we could see the Real Self within, 
and instead of condemning them, say, "Rise thou effulgent one, 


 
 
86 
 
rise thou who art always pure, rise thou birthless and deathless, 
rise almighty, and manifest thy true nature.  
 
These little manifestations do not befit thee." This is the highest 
prayer that the Advaita teaches. This is the one prayer, to 
remember our true nature, the God who is always within us, 
thinking of it always as infinite, almighty, ever-good, ever-
beneficent, selfless, bereft of all limitations. And because that 
nature is selfless, it is strong and fearless; for only to selfishness 
comes fear. He who has nothing to desire for himself, whom 
does he fear, and what can frighten him? What fear has death 
for him? What fear has evil for him? So, if we are Advaitists, 
we must think from this moment that our old self is dead and 
gone. The old Mr., Mrs., and Miss So-and-so are gone, they were 
mere
 superstitions, and what remains is the everpure, the ever- 
strong, the almighty, the all-knowing — that alone remains for 
us, and then all fear vanishes from us. Who can injure us, the 
omnipresent? All weakness has vanished from us, and our only 
work is to arouse this knowledge in our fellowbeings. We see 
that they too are the same pure self, only they do not know it; 
we must teach them, we must help them to rouse up their infinite 
nature.  
 
This is what I feel to be absolutely necessary all over the world. 
These doctrines are old, older than many mountains possibly. 
All truth is eternal. Truth is nobody's property; no race, no 
individual can lay any exclusive claim to it. Truth is the nature 
of all souls. Who can lay any special claim to it? But it has to be 


 
 
87 
 
made practical, to be made simple (for the highest truths are 
always simple), so that it may penetrate every pore of human 
society, and become the property of the highest intellects and 
the commonest minds, of the man, woman, and child at the same 
time. All these ratiocinations of logic, all these bundles of 
metaphysics, all these theologies and ceremonies may have been 
good in their own time, but let us try to make things simpler and 
bring about the golden days when every man will be a 
worshipper, and the Reality in every man will be the object of 
worship.

Jnana Yoga 
The Real & The Apparent Man 
(Delivered in New York) 
 
 
Here we stand, and our eyes look forward sometimes miles 
ahead. Man has been doing that since he began to think. He is 
always looking forward, looking ahead. He wants to know 
where he goes even after the dissolution of his body. Various 
theories have been propounded, system after system has been 
brought forward to suggest explanations. Some have been 
rejected, while others have been accepted, and thus it will go on, 
so long as man is here, so long as man thinks. There is some 
truth in each of these systems. There is a good deal of what is 
not truth in all of them. I shall try to place before you the sum 
and substance, the result, of the inquiries in this line that have 
been made in India. I shall try to harmonise the various thoughts 
on the subject, as they have come up from time to time among 
Indian philosophers. I shall try to harmonise the psychologists 
and the metaphysicians, and, if possible, I shall harmonise them 
with modern scientific thinkers also. 
 
 


 
 
89 
 
The one theme of the Vedanta philosophy is the search after 
unity. The Hindu mind does not care for the particular; it is 
always after the general, nay, the universal. "What is that, by 
knowing which everything else is to be known?" That is the one 
theme. "As through the knowledge of one lump of clay all that 
is of clay is known, so, what is that, by knowing which this 
whole universe itself will be known?" That is the one search. 
The whole of this universe, according to the Hindu 
philosophers, can be resolved into one material, which they call 
Âkâsha. Everything that we see around us, feel, touch, taste, is 
simply a differentiated manifestation of this Akasha. It is all-
pervading, fine. All that we call solids, liquids, or gases, figures, 
forms, or bodies, the earth, sun, moon, and stars — everything 
is composed of this Akasha. 
 
What force is it which acts upon this Akasha and manufactures 
this universe out of it? Along with Akasha exists universal 
power; all that is power in the universe, manifesting as force or 
attraction — nay, even as thought — is but a different 
manifestation of that one power which the Hindus call Prâna. 
This Prana, acting on Akasha, is creating the whole of this 
universe. In the beginning of a cycle, this Prana, as it were, 
sleeps in the infinite ocean of Akasha. It existed motionless in 
the beginning. Then arises motion in this ocean of Akasha by 
the action of this Prana, and as this Prana begins to move, to 
vibrate, out of this ocean come the various celestial systems, 
suns, moons, stars, earth, human beings, animals, plants, and the 
manifestations of all the various forces and phenomena. 


 
 
90 
 
Every manifestation of power, therefore, according to them, is 
this Prana. Every material manifestation is Akasha. When this 
cycle will end, all that we call solid will melt away into the next 
form, the next finer or the liquid form; that will melt into the 
gaseous, and that into finer and more uniform heat
 vibrations, 
and all will melt back into the original Akasha, and what we now 
call attraction, repulsion, and motion, will slowly resolve into 
the original Prana. Then this Prana is said to sleep for a period, 
again to emerge and to throw out all those forms; and when this 
period will end, the whole thing will subside again. Thus this 
process of creation is going down, and coming up, oscillating 
backwards and forwards. In the language of modern science, it 
is becoming static during one period, and during another period 
it is becoming dynamic. At one time it becomes potential, and 
at the next period it becomes active.
 This alteration has gone on 
through eternity.
 
 
Yet, this analysis is only partial. This much has been known 
even to modern physical science. Beyond that, the research of 
physical science cannot reach. But the inquiry does not stop in 
consequence. We have not yet found that one, by knowing 
which everything else will be known. We have resolved the 
whole universe into two components, into what are called matter 
and energy, or what the ancient philosophers of India called 
Akasha and Prana. The next step is to resolve this Akasha and 
the Prana into their origin. Both can be resolved into the still 
higher entity which is called mind. It is out of mind, the Mahat, 
the universally existing thought-power, that these two have been 


 
 
91 
 
produced. Thought is a still finer manifestation of being than 
either Akasha or Prana. It is thought that splits itself into these 
two. The universal thought existed in the beginning, and that 
manifested, changed, evolved itself into these two Akasha and 
Prana: and by the combination of these two the whole universe 
has been produced. 
 
We next come to psychology. I am looking at you. The external 
sensations are brought to me by the eyes; they are carried by the 
sensory nerves to the brain. The eyes are not the organs of 
vision. They are but the external instruments, because if the real 
organ behind, that which carries the sensation to the brain, is 
destroyed, I may have twenty eyes, yet I cannot see you. The 
picture on the retina may be as complete as possible, yet I shall 
not see you. Therefore, the organ is different from its 
instruments; behind the instruments, the eyes, there must be the 
organ. So it is with all the sensations. The nose is not the sense 
of smell; it is but the instrument, and behind it is the organ. With 
every sense we have, there is first the external instrument in the 
physical body; behind that in the same physical body, there is 
the organ; yet these are not sufficient. Suppose I am talking to 
you, and you are listening to me with close attention. 
 
Something happens, say, a bell rings; you will not, perhaps, hear 
the bell ring. The pulsations of that sound came to your ear, 
struck the tympanum, the impression was carried by the nerve 
into the brain; if the whole process was complete up to carrying 
the impulse to the brain, why did you not hear? 


 
 
92 
 
 
Something else was wanting — the mind was not attached to the 
organ. When the mind detaches itself from the organ, the organ 
may bring any news to it, but the mind will not receive it. When 
it attaches itself to the organ, then alone is it possible for the mind 
to receive the news. Yet, even that does not complete the whole. 
The instruments may bring the sensation from outside, the 
organs may carry it inside, the mind may attach itself to the 
organ, and yet the perception may not be complete. One more 
factor is necessary; there must be a reaction within. With this 
reaction comes knowledge. That which is outside sends, as it 
were, the current of news into my brain. My mind takes it up, 
and presents it to the intellect, which groups it in relation to pre-
received impressions and sends a current of reaction, and with 
that reaction comes perception. Here, then, is the will. The state 
of mind which reacts is called Buddhi, the intellect. Yet, even 
this does not complete the whole. One step more is required. 
Suppose here is a camera and there is a sheet of cloth, and I try 
to throw a picture on that sheet. What am I to do? I am to guide 
various rays of light through the camera to fall upon the sheet 
and become grouped there. Something is necessary to have the 
picture thrown upon, which does not move. I cannot form a 
picture upon something which is moving; that something must 
be stationary, because the rays of light which I throw on it are 
moving, and these moving rays of light, must be gathered, 
unified, co-ordinated, and completed upon something which is 
stationary. 
 


 
 
93 
 
Similar is the case with the sensations which these organs of 
ours are carrying inside and presenting to the mind, and which 
the mind in its turn is presenting to the intellect. This process 
will not be complete unless there is something permanent in the 
background upon which the picture, as it were, may be formed, 
upon which we may unify all the different impressions. What is 
it that gives unity to the changing whole of our being? What is 
it that keeps up the identity of the moving thing moment after 
moment? What is it upon which all our different impressions are 
pieced together, upon which the perceptions, as it were, come 
together, reside, and form a united whole? We have found that 
to serve this end there must be something, and we also see that 
that something must be, relatively to the body and mind, 
motionless. The sheet of cloth upon which the camera throws the 
picture is, relatively to the rays of light, motionless, else there 
will be no picture. That is to say, the perceiver must be an 
individual. This something upon which the mind is painting all 
these pictures, this something upon which our sensations, 
carried by the mind and intellect, are placed and grouped and 
formed into a unity, is what is called the soul of man. 
 
We have seen that it is the universal cosmic mind that splits 
itself into the Akasha and Prana, and beyond mind we have 
found the soul in us. In the universe, behind the universal mind, 
there is a Soul that exists, and it is called God. In the individual 
it is the soul of man. In this universe, in the cosmos, just as the 
universal mind becomes evolved into Akasha and Prana, even 
so, we may find that the Universal Soul Itself becomes evolved 


 
 
94 
 
as mind. Is it really so with the individual man? Is his mind the 
creator of his body, and his soul the creator of his mind? That is 
to say, are his body, his mind, and his soul three different 
existences or are they three in one or, again, are they different 
states of existence of the same unit being? We shall gradually 
try to find an answer to this question. The first step that we have 
now gained is this: here is this external body, behind this 
external body are the organs, the mind, the intellect, and behind 
this is the soul. At the first step, we have found, as it were, that 
the soul is separate from the body, separate from the mind itself. 
Opinions in the religious world become divided at this point, and 
the departure is this. All those religious views which generally 
pass under the name of dualism hold that this soul is qualified, 
that it is of various qualities, that all feelings of enjoyment, 
pleasure, and pain really belong to the soul. The non-dualists 
deny that the soul has any such qualities; they say it is 
unqualified. 
 
Let me first take up the dualists, and try to present to you their 
position with regard to the soul and its destiny; next, the system 
that contradicts them; and lastly, let us try to find the harmony 
which non-dualism will bring to us. This soul of man, because 
it is separate from the mind and body, because it is not 
composed of Akasha and Prana, must be immortal.Why? What 
do we mean by mortality? Decomposition. And that is only 
possible for things that are the result of composition; anything 
that is made of two or three ingredients must become 
decomposed. 


 
 
95 
 
That alone which is not the result of composition can never 
become decomposed, and, therefore, can never die. It is 
immortal. It has been existing throughout eternity; it is uncreate. 
Every item of creation is simply a composition; no one ever saw 
creation come out of nothing. All that we know of creation is the 
combination of already existing things into newer forms. That 
being so, this soul of man, being simple, must have been existing 
forever, and it will exist forever. 
 
When this body falls off, the soul lives on. According to the 
Vedantists, when this body dissolves, the vital forces of the man 
go back to his mind and the mind becomes dissolved, as it were, 
into the Prana, and that Prana enters into the soul of man, and 
the soul of man comes out, clothed, as it were, with what they 
call the fine body, the mental body, or spiritual body, as you may 
like to call it. In this body are the Samskâras of the man. What 
are the Samskaras? This mind is like a lake, and every thought 
is like a wave upon that lake. Just as in the lake waves rise and 
then fall down and disappear, so these thought-waves are 
continually rising in the mind-stuff and then disappearing, but 
they do not disappear forever. They become finer and finer, but 
they are all there, ready to start up at another time when called 
upon to do so. 
 
Memory is simply calling back into waveform some of those 
thoughts which have gone into that finer state of existence. 
Thus, everything that we have thought, every action that we have 
done, is lodged in the mind; it is all there in fine form, and when 


 
 
96 
 
a man dies, the sum total of these impressions is in the mind, 
which again works upon a little fine material as a medium. The 
soul, clothed, as it were, with these impressions and the fine 
body, passes out, and the destiny of the soul is guided by the 
resultant of all the different forces represented by the different 
impressions. According to us, there are three different goals for 
the soul. 
 
Those that are very spiritual, when they die, follow the solar rays 
and reach what is called the solar sphere, through which they 
reach what is called the lunar sphere, and through that they reach 
what is called the sphere of lightning, and there they meet with 
another soul who is already blessed, and he guides the new-
comer forward to the highest of all spheres, which is called the 
Brahmaloka, the sphere of Brahmâ. There these souls attain to 
omniscience and omnipotence, become almost as powerful and 
all-knowing as God Himself; and they reside there forever, 
according to the dualists, or, according to the non- dualists, they 
become one with the Universal at the end of the cycle.  
 
The next class of persons, who have been doing good work with 
selfish motives, are carried by the results of their good works, 
when they die, to what is called lunar sphere, where there are 
various heavens, and there they acquire fine bodies, the bodies 
of gods. They become gods and live there and enjoy the blessing 
of heaven for a long period; and after that period is finished, the 
old Karma is again upon them, and so they fall back again to the 
earth; they come down through the spheres of air and clouds and 


 
 
97 
 
all these various regions, and, at last, reach the earth through 
raindrops. 
 
There on the earth they attach themselves to some cereal which 
is eventually eaten by some man who is fit to supply them with 
material to make a new body. The last class, namely, the wicked, 
when they die, become ghosts or demons, and live somewhere 
midway between the lunar sphere and this earth. 
 
Some try to disturb mankind, some are friendly; and after living 
there for some time they also fall back to the earth and become 
animals. After living for some time in an animal body they get 
released, and come back, and become men again, and thus get 
one more chance to work out their salvation. We see, then, that 
those who have nearly attained to perfection, in whom only very 
little of impurity remains, go to the Brahmaloka through the rays 
of the sun; those who were a middling sort of people, who did 
some good work here with the idea of going to heaven, go to the 
heavens in the lunar sphere and there obtain god-bodies; but 
they have again to become men and so have one more chance to 
become perfect. Those that are very wicked become ghosts and 
demons, and then they may have to become animals; after that 
they become men again and get another chance to perfect 
themselves. This earth is called the Karma-Bhumi, the sphere of 
Karma. Here alone man makes his good or bad Karma. When a 
man wants to go to heaven and does good works for that 
purpose, he becomes as good and does not as such store up any 
bad Karma. He just enjoys the effects of the good work he did 


 
 
98 
 
on earth; and when this good Karma is exhausted, there come, 
upon him the resultant force of all the evil Karma he had 
previously stored up in life, and that brings him down again to 
this earth. In the same way, those that become ghosts remain in 
that state, not giving rise to fresh Karma, but suffer the evil 
results of their past misdeeds, and later on remain for a time in 
an animal body without causing any fresh Karma.  
 
When that period is finished, they too become men again. The 
states of reward and punishment due to good and bad Karmas 
are devoid of the force generating fresh Karmas; they have only 
to be enjoyed or suffered. If there is an extraordinarily good or 
an extraordinarily evil Karma, it bears fruit very quickly. For 
instance, if a man has been doing many evil things all his life, 
but does one good act, the result of that good act will 
immediately appear, but when that result has been gone through, 
all the evil acts must produce their results also. All men who do 
certain good and great acts, but the general tenor of whose lives 
has not been correct, will become gods; and after living for some 
time in god-bodies, enjoying the powers of gods, they will have 
again to become men; when the power of the good acts is thus 
finished, the old evil comes up to be worked out.  
 
Those who do extraordinarily evil acts have to put on ghost and 
devil bodies, and when the effect of those evil actions is 
exhausted, the little good action which remains associated with 
them, makes them again become men. The way to Brahmaloka, 
from which there is no more fall or return, is called the 


 
 
99 
 
Devayâna, i.e. the way to God; the way to heaven is known as 
Pitriyâna, i.e. the way to the fathers. 
 
Man, therefore, according to the Vedanta philosophy, is the 
greatest being that is in the universe, and this world of work the 
best place in it, because only herein is the greatest and the best 
chance for him to become perfect. Angels or gods, whatever you 
may call them, have all to become men, if they want to become 
perfect. This is the great centre, the wonderful poise, and the 
wonderful opportunity — this human life. 
 
We come next to the other aspect of philosophy. There are 
Buddhists who deny the whole theory of the soul that I have just 
now been propounding. "What use is there," says the Buddhist, 
"to assume something as the substratum, as the background of 
this body and mind? Why may we not allow thoughts to run on? 
Why admit a third substance beyond this organism, composed 
of mind and body, a third substance called the soul? What is its 
use? Is not this organism sufficient to explain itself? Why take 
anew a third something?" These arguments are very powerful. 
This reasoning is very strong.  
 
So far as outside research goes, we see that this organism is a 
sufficient explanation of itself — at least, many of us see it in 
that light. Why then need there be a soul as substratum, as a 
something which is neither mind nor body but stands as a 
background for both mind and body? Let there be only mind and 


 
 
100 
 
body. Body is the name of a stream of matter continuously 
changing. Mind is the name of a stream of consciousness or 
thought continuously changing. What produces the apparent 
unity between these two? This unity does not really exist, let us 
say. Take, for instance, a lighted torch, and whirl it rapidly 
before you. You see a circle of fire. 
 
The circle does not really exist, but because the torch is 
continually moving, it leaves the appearance of a circle. So 
there is no unity in this life; it is a mass of matter continually 
rushing down, and the whole of this matter you may call one 
unity, but no more. So is mind; each thought is separate from 
every other thought; it is only the rushing current that leaves 
behind the illusion of unity; there is no need of a third substance. 
This universal phenomenon of body and mind is all that really 
is; do not posit something behind it. You will find that this 
Buddhist thought has been taken up by certain sects and schools 
in modern times, and all of them claim that it is new — their 
own invention. This has been the central idea of most of the 
Buddhistic philosophies, that this world is itself all-sufficient; 
that you need not ask for any background at all; all that is, is this 
sense-universe: what is the use of thinking of something as a 
support to this universe?  
 
Everything is the aggregate of qualities; why should there be a 
hypothetical substance in which they should inhere? The idea of 
substance comes from the rapid interchange of qualities, not 
from something unchangeable which exists behind them. We 


 
 
101 
 
see how wonderful some of these arguments are, and they 
appeal easily to the ordinary experience of humanity — in fact, 
not one in a million can think of anything other than phenomena. 
To the vast majority of men nature appears to be only a 
changing, whirling, combining, mingling mass of change. Few 
of us ever have a glimpse of the calm sea behind. For us it is 
always lashed into waves; this universe appears to us only as a 
tossing mass of waves. Thus we find these two opinions. One is 
that there is something behind both body and mind which is an 
unchangeable and immovable substance; and the other is that 
there is no such thing as immovability or unchangeability in the 
universe; it is all change and nothing but change. The solution 
of this difference comes in the next step of thought, namely, the 
non-dualistic. 
 
It says that the dualists are right in finding something behind all, 
as a background which does not change; we cannot conceive 
change without there being something unchangeable. We can 
only conceive of anything that is changeable, by knowing 
something which is less changeable, and this also must appear 
more changeable in comparison with something else which is 
less changeable, and so on and on, until we are bound to admit 
that there must be something which never changes at all. The 
whole of this manifestation must have been in a state of non-
manifestation, calm and silent, being the balance of opposing 
forces, so to say, when no force operated, because force acts 
when a disturbance of the equilibrium comes in.  
 


 
 
102 
 
The universe is ever hurrying on to return to that state of 
equilibrium again. If we are certain of any fact whatsoever, we 
are certain of this. When the dualists claim that there is a 
something which does not change, they are perfectly right, but 
their analysis that it is an underlying something which is neither 
the body nor the mind, a something separate from both, is 
wrong. So far as the Buddhists say that the whole universe is a 
mass of change, they are perfectly right; so long as I am separate 
from the universe, so long as I stand back and look at something 
before me, so long as there are two things — the looker-on and 
the thing looked upon — it will appear always that the universe 
is one of change, continuously changing all the time. But the 
reality is that there is both change and changelessness in this 
universe. It is not that the soul and the mind and the body are 
three separate existences, for this organism made of these three 
is really one. 
 
It is the same thing which appears as the body, as the mind, and 
as the thing beyond mind and body, but it is not at the same time 
all these. He who sees the body does not see the mind even, he 
who sees the mind does not see that which he calls the soul, and 
he who sees the soul — for him the body and mind have 
vanished. He who sees only motion never sees absolute calm, 
and he who sees absolute calm — for him motion has vanished. 
A rope is taken for a snake. He who sees the rope as the snake, 
for him the rope has vanished, and when the delusion ceases and 
he looks at the rope, the snake has vanished. There is then but 
one all-comprehending existence, and that one appears as 


 
 
103 
 
manifold. This Self or Soul or Substance is all that exists in the 
universe. That Self or Substance or Soul is, in the language of 
non-dualism, the Brahman appearing to be manifold by the 
interposition of name and form. 
 
Look at the waves in the sea. Not one wave is really different 
from the sea, but what makes the wave apparently different? 
Name and form; the form of the wave and the name which we 
give to it, "wave". This is what makes it different from the sea. 
When name and form go, it is the same sea. Who can make any 
real difference between the wave and the sea? So this whole 
universe is that one Unit Existence; name and form have created 
all these various differences. As when the sun shines upon 
millions of globules of water, upon each particle is seen a most 
perfect representation of the sun, so the one Soul, the one Self, 
the one Existence of the universe, being reflected on all these 
numerous globules of varying names and forms, appears to be 
various. But it is in reality only one. There is no "I" nor "you"; 
it is all one. It is either all "I" or all "you". This idea of duality, 
calf two, is entirely false, and the whole universe, as we 
ordinarily know it, is the result of this false knowledge. 
 
When discrimination comes and man finds there are not two but 
one, he finds that he is himself this universe. "It is I who am this 
universe as it now exists, a continuous mass of change. It is I 
who am beyond all changes, beyond all qualities, the eternally 
perfect, the eternally blessed." 
 


 
 
104 
 
There is, therefore, but one Atman, one Self, eternally pure, 
eternally perfect, unchangeable, unchanged; it has never 
changed; and all these various changes in the universe are but 
appearances in that one Self. 
 
Upon it name and form have painted all these dreams; it is the 
form that makes the wave different from the sea. Suppose the 
wave subsides, will the form remain? No, it will vanish. The 
existence of the wave was entirely dependent upon the existence 
of the sea, but the existence of the sea was not at all dependent 
upon the existence of the wave. The form remains so long as the 
wave remains, but as soon as the wave leaves it, it vanishes, it 
cannot remain.  
 
 
This name and form is the outcome of what is called Maya. It is 
this Maya that is making individuals, making one appear 
different from another. Yet it has no existence. 
 
Maya cannot be said to exist. Form cannot be said to exist, 
because it depends upon the existence of another thing. It cannot 
be said as not to exist, seeing that it makes all this difference. 
According to the Advaita philosophy, then, this Maya or 
ignorance — or name and form, or, as it has been called in 
Europe, "time, space, and causality" — is out of this one Infinite 
Existence showing us the manifoldness of the universe; in 
substance, this universe is one. So long as any one thinks that 
there are two ultimate realities, he is mistaken. 


 
 
105 
 
 
When he has come to know that there is but one, he is right. This 
is what is being proved to us every day, on the physical plane, on 
the mental plane, and also on the spiritual plane. 
 
Today it has been demonstrated that you and I, the sun, the 
moon, and the stars are but the different names of different spots 
in the same ocean of matter, and that this matter is continuously 
changing in its configuration. This particle of energy that was in 
the sun several months ago may be in the human being now; 
tomorrow it may be in an animal, the day after tomorrow it may 
be in a plant. It is ever coming and going. 
 
It is all one unbroken, infinite mass of matter, only differentiated 
by names and forms. One point is called the sun; another, the 
moon; another, the stars; another, man; another, animal; 
another, plant; and so on. And all these names are fictitious; they 
have no reality, because the whole is a continuously changing 
mass of matter. This very same universe, from another 
standpoint, is an ocean of thought, where each one of us is a 
point called a particular mind. You are a mind, I am a mind, 
everyone is a mind; and the very same universe viewed from the 
standpoint of knowledge, when the eyes have been cleared of 
delusions, when the mind has become pure, appears to be the 
unbroken Absolute Being, the ever pure, the unchangeable, the 
immortal. 
 
 


 
 
106 
 
What then becomes of all this threefold eschatology of the 
dualist, that when a man dies he goes to heaven, or goes to this 
or that sphere, and that the wicked persons become ghosts, and 
become animals, and so forth? None comes and none goes, says 
the non-dualist. How can you come and go? You are infinite; 
where is the place for you to go? In a certain school a number of 
little children were being examined. The examiner had foolishly 
put all sorts of difficult questions to the little children. Among 
others there was this question: "Why does not the earth fall ?" 
His intention was to bring out the idea of gravitation or some 
other intricate scientific truth from these children. Most of them 
could not even understand the question, and so they gave all 
sorts of wrong answers.  
 
But one bright little girl answered it with another question: 
"Where shall it fall?" The very question of the examiner was 
nonsense on the face of it. There is no up and down in the 
universe; the idea is only relative. So it is with regard to the soul; 
the very question of birth and death in regard to it is utter 
nonsense. Who goes and who comes? Where are you not? 
Where is the heaven that you are not in already? Omnipresent is 
the Self of man. Where is it to go? Where is it not to go? It is 
everywhere. So all this childish dream and puerile illusion of 
birth and death, of heavens and higher heavens and lower 
worlds, all vanish immediately for the perfect. For the nearly 
perfect it vanishes after showing them the several scenes up to 
Brahmaloka. It continues for the ignorant. 
 


 
 
107 
 
How is it that the whole world believes in going to heaven, and 
in dying and being born? I am studying a book, page after page 
is being read and turned over. Another page comes and is turned 
over. Who changes? Who comes and goes? Not I, but the book. 
This whole nature is a book before the soul, chapter after chapter 
is being read and turned over, and every now and then a scene 
opens. That is read and turned over. A fresh one comes, but the 
soul is ever the same — eternal. It is nature that is changing, not 
the soul of man. This never changes. Birth and death are in 
nature, not in you. Yet the ignorant are deluded; just as we under 
delusion think that the sun is moving and not the earth, in 
exactly the same way we think that we are dying, and not nature. 
These are all, therefore, hallucinations. 
 
Just as it is a hallucination when we think that the fields are 
moving and not the railway train, exactly in the same manner is 
the hallucination of birth and death. When men are in a certain 
frame of mind, they see this very existence as the earth, as the 
sun, the moon, the stars; and all those who are in the same state 
of mind see the same things. Between you and me there may be 
millions of beings on different planes of existence. They will 
never see us, nor we them; we only see those who are in the same 
state of mind and on the same plane with us. Those musical 
instruments respond which have the same attunement of 
vibration, as it were; if the state of vibration, which they call 
"man- vibration", should be changed, no longer would men be 
seen here; the whole "man- universe" would vanish, and instead 
of that, other scenery would come before us, perhaps gods and 


 
 
108 
 
the god-universe, or perhaps, for the wicked man, devils and the 
diabolic world; but all would be only different views of the one 
universe. It is this universe which, from the human plane, is seen 
as the earth, the sun, the moon, the stars, and all such things — 
it is this very universe which, seen from the plane of 
wickedness, appears as a place of punishment. 
 
And this very universe is seen as heaven by those who want to 
see it as heaven. Those who have been dreaming of going to a 
God who is sitting on a throne, and of standing there praising 
Him all their lives, when they die, will simply see a vision of 
what they have in their minds; this very universe will simply 
change into a vast heaven, with all sorts of winged beings flying 
about and a God sitting on a throne. These heavens are all of 
man's own making. So what the dualist says is true, says the 
Advaitin, but it is all simply of his own making. These spheres 
and devils and gods and reincarnations and transmigrations are 
all mythology; so also is this human life. The great mistake that 
men always make is to think that this life alone is true. They 
understand it well enough when other things are called 
mythologies, but are never willing to admit the same of their 
own position. 
 
The whole thing as it appears is mere
 mythology, and the 
greatest of all lies is that we are bodies, which we never were 
nor even can be. It is the greatest of all lies that we are mere 
men; we are the God of the universe. In worshipping God we 
have been always worshipping our own hidden Self. The worst 


 
 
109 
 
lie that you ever tell yourself is that you were born a sinner or a 
wicked man. He alone is a sinner who sees a sinner in another 
man.
 
 
Suppose there is a baby here, and you place a bag of gold on the 
table. Suppose a robber comes and takes the gold away. To the 
baby it is all the same; because there is no robber inside, there 
is no robber outside. To sinners and vile men, there is vileness 
outside, but not to good men. So the wicked see this universe as 
a hell, and the partially good see it as heaven, while the perfect 
beings realise it as God Himself. 
 
Then alone the veil falls from the eyes, and the man, purified 
and cleansed, finds his whole vision changed. The bad dreams 
that have been torturing him for millions of years, all vanish, 
and he who was thinking of himself either as a man, or a god, or 
a demon, he who was thinking of himself as living in low places, 
in high places, on earth, in heaven, and so on, finds that he is 
really omnipresent; that all time is in him, and that he is not in 
time; that all the heavens are in him, that he is not in any heaven; 
and that all the gods that man ever worshipped are in him, and 
that he is not in any one of those gods. 
 
He was the manufacturer of gods and demons, of men and plants 
and animals and stones, and the real nature of man now stands 
unfolded to him as being higher than heaven, more perfect than 
this universe of ours, more infinite than infinite time, more 
omnipresent than the omnipresent ether. Thus alone man 


 
 
110 
 
becomes fearless, and becomes free. Then all delusions cease, 
all miseries vanish, all fears come to an end for ever. Birth goes 
away and with it death; pains fly, and with them fly away 
pleasures; earths vanish, and with them vanish heavens; bodies 
vanish, and with them vanishes the mind also. For that man 
disappears the whole universe, as it were. This searching, 
moving, continuous struggle of forces stops for ever, and that 
which was manifesting itself as force and matter, as struggles of 
nature, as nature itself, as heavens and earths and plants and 
animals and men and angels, all that becomes transfigured into 
one infinite, unbreakable, unchangeable existence, and the 
knowing man finds that he is one with that existence. "Even as 
clouds of various colours come before the sky, remain there for 
a second and then vanish away," even so before this soul are all 
these visions coming, of earths and heavens, of the moon and 
the gods, of pleasures and pains; but they all pass away leaving 
the one infinite, blue, unchangeable sky. The sky never changes; 
it is the clouds that change. It is a mistake to think that the sky 
is changed. It is a mistake to think that we are impure, that we 
are limited, that we are separate. The real man is the one Unit 
Existence. 
 
Two questions now arise. The first is: "Is it possible to realise 
this? So far it is doctrine, philosophy, but is it possible to realise 
it?" It is. There are men still living in this world for whom 
delusion has vanished for ever. Do they immediately die after 
such realisation? Not so soon as we should think. 
 
 


 
 
111 
 
Two wheels joined by one pole are running together. If I get 
hold of one of the wheels and, with an axe, cut the pole asunder, 
the wheel which I have got hold of stops, but upon the other 
wheel is its past momentum, so it runs on a little and then falls 
down. This pure and perfect being, the soul, is one wheel, and 
this external hallucination of body and mind is the other wheel, 
joined together by the pole of work, of Karma. 
Knowledge is the axe which will sever the bond between the 
two, and the wheel of the soul will stop — stop thinking that it 
is coming and going, living and dying, stop thinking that it is 
nature and has wants and desires, and will find that it is perfect, 
desireless. But upon the other wheel, that of the body and mind, 
will be the momentum of past acts; so it will live for some time, 
until that momentum of past work is exhausted, until that 
momentum is worked away, and then the body and mind fall, 
and the soul becomes free. 
 
No more is there any going to heaven and coming back, not even 
any going to the Brahmaloka, or to any of the highest of the 
spheres, for where is he to come from, or to go to? The man who 
has in this life attained to this state, for whom, for a minute at 
least, the ordinary vision of the world has changed and the 
reality has been apparent, he is called the "Living Free". This is 
the goal of the Vedantin, to attain freedom while living. 
 
Once in Western India I was travelling in the desert country on 
the coast of the Indian Ocean. For days and days I used to travel 
on foot through the desert, but it was to my surprise that I saw 


 
 
112 
 
every day beautiful lakes, with trees all round them, and the 
shadows of the trees upside down and vibrating there.  
 
"How wonderful it looks and they call this a desert country!" I 
said to myself. Nearly a month I travelled, seeing these 
wonderful lakes and trees and plants. One day I was very thirsty 
and wanted to have a drink of water, so I started to go to one of 
these clear, beautiful lakes, and as I approached, it vanished. 
And with a flash it came to my brain, "This is the mirage about 
which I have read all my life," and with that came also the idea 
that throughout the whole of this month, every day, I had been 
seeing the mirage and did not know it. 
 
The next morning I began my march. There was again the lake, 
but with it came also the idea that it was the mirage and not a 
true lake. So is it with this universe. We are all travelling in this 
mirage of the world day after day, month after month, year after 
year, not knowing that it is a mirage. One day it will break up, 
but it will come back again; the body has to remain under the 
power of past Karma, and so the mirage will come back. This 
world will come back upon us so long as we are bound by 
Karma: men, women, animals, plants, our attachments and 
duties, all will come back to us, but not with the same power. 
Under the influence of the new knowledge the strength of 
Karma will be broken, its poison will be lost. It becomes 
transformed, for along with it there comes the idea that we know 
it now, that the sharp distinction between the reality and the 
mirage has been known. 


 
 
113 
 
This world will not then be the same world as before. There is, 
however, a danger here. We see in every country people taking 
up this philosophy and saying, "I am beyond all virtue and vice; 
so I am not bound by any moral laws; I may do anything I like." 
You may find many fools in this country at the present time, 
saying, "I am not bound; I am God Himself; let me do anything 
I like." This is not right, although it is true that the soul is beyond 
all laws, physical, mental, or moral.  
 
Within law is bondage; beyond law is freedom. It is also true 
that freedom is of the nature of the soul, it is its birthright: that 
real freedom of the soul shines through veils of matter in the 
form of the apparent freedom of man. Every moment of your 
life you feel that you are free. We cannot live, talk, or breathe 
for a moment without feeling that we are free; but, at the same 
time, a little thought shows us that we are like machines and not 
free. What is true then? Is this idea of freedom a delusion? 
 
One party holds that the idea of freedom is a delusion; another 
says that the idea of bondage is a delusion. How does this 
happen? Man is really free, the real man cannot but be free. It is 
when he comes into the world of Maya, into name and form, 
that he becomes bound. Free will is a misnomer. Will can never 
be free. How can it be? It is only when the real man has become 
bound that his will comes into existence, and not before. 
 
The will of man is bound, but that which is the foundation of 
that will is eternally free. So, even in the state of bondage which 


 
 
114 
 
we call human life or god-life, on earth or in heaven, there yet 
remains to us that recollection of the freedom which is ours by 
divine right. 
 
And consciously or unconsciously we are all struggling towards 
it. When a man has attained his own freedom, how can he be 
bound by any law? No law in this universe can bind him, for this 
universe itself is his. 
 
He is the whole universe. Either say he is the whole universe or 
say that to him there is no universe. How can he have then all 
these little ideas about sex and about country? How can he say, 
I am a man, I am a woman I am a child? Are they not lies? He 
knows that they are. How can he say that these are man's rights, 
and these others are woman's rights? Nobody has rights; nobody 
separately exists. There is neither man nor woman; the soul is 
sexless, eternally pure. It is a lie to say that I am a man or a 
woman, or to say that I belong to this country or that. All the 
world is my country, the whole universe is mine, because I have 
clothed myself with it as my body. Yet we see that there are 
people in this world who are ready to assert these doctrines, and 
at the same time do things which we should call filthy; and if we 
ask them why they do so, they tell us that it is our delusion and 
that they can do nothing wrong. 
 
What is the test by which they are to be judged? The test is here. 
 
 


 
 
115 
 
Though evil and good are both conditioned manifestations of 
the soul, yet evil is the most external coating, and good is the 
nearer coating of the real man, the Self. And unless a man cuts 
through the layer of evil he cannot reach the layer of good, and 
unless he has passed through both the layers of good and evil he 
cannot reach the Self. He who reaches the Self, what remains 
attached to him? A little Karma, a little bit of the momentum of 
past life, but it is all good momentum. Until the bad momentum 
is entirely worked out and past impurities are entirely burnt, it is 
impossible for any man to see and realize
 truth. So, what is left 
attached to the man who has reached the Self and seen the truth 
is the remnant of the good impressions of past life, the good 
momentum. Even if he lives in the body and works incessantly, 
he works only to do good; his lips speak only benediction to all; 
his hands do only good works; his mind can only think good 
thoughts; his presence is a blessing wherever he goes. He is 
himself a living blessing. 
 
Such a man will, by his very presence, change even the most 
wicked persons into saints. Even if he does not speak, his very 
presence will be a blessing to mankind. Can such men do any 
evil; can they do wicked deeds? There is, you must remember, 
all the difference of pole to pole between realisation and mere 
talking.  
 
Any fool can talk. Even parrots talk. Talking is one thing, and 
realising is another. Philosophies, and doctrines, and arguments, 
and books, and theories, and churches, and sects, and all these 


 
 
116 
 
things are good in their own way; but when that realisation 
comes, these things drop away. For instance, maps are good, but 
when you see the country itself, and look again at the maps, what 
a great difference you find! So those that have realised truth do 
not require the ratiocinations of logic and all other gymnastics 
of the intellect to make them understand the truth; it is to them 
the life of their lives, concretised, made more than tangible. It 
is, as the sages of the Vedanta say, "even as a fruit in your hand"; 
you can stand up and say, it is here. 
 
So those that have realised the truth will stand up and say, "Here 
is the Self". You may argue with them by the year, but they will 
smile at you; they will regard it all as child's prattle; they will 
let the child prattle on. They have realised the truth and are full. 
Suppose you have seen a country, and another man comes to 
you and tries to argue with you that that country never existed, 
he may go on arguing indefinitely, but your only attitude of 
mind towards him must be to hold that the man is fit for a lunatic 
asylum. So the man of realisation says, "All this talk in the world 
about its little religions is but prattle; realisation is the soul, the 
very essence of religion." Religion can be realised. Are you 
ready? Do you want it? You will get the realisation if you do, 
and then you will be truly religious. Until you have attained 
realisation there is no difference between you and atheists. The 
atheists are sincere, but the man who says that he believes in 
religion and never attempts to realise it is not sincere. 
 
The next question is to know what comes after realisation. 


 
 
117 
 
Suppose we have realised this oneness of the universe, that we 
are that one Infinite Being, and suppose we have realised that 
this Self is the only Existence and that it is the same Self which 
is manifesting in all these various phenomenal forms, what 
becomes of us after that? Shall we become inactive, get into a 
corner and sit down there and die away? "What good will it do 
to the world?" That old question! In the first place, why should 
it do good to the world? Is there any reason why it should? 
 
What right has any one to ask the question, "What good will it 
do to the world?" What is meant by that? A baby likes candies. 
Suppose you are conducting investigations in connection with 
some subject of electricity and the baby asks you, "Does it buy 
candies?" "No" you answer. "Then what good will it do?" says 
the baby. So men stand up and say, "What good will this do to 
the world; will it give us money?" "No." "Then what good is 
there in it?" That is what men mean by doing good to the world. 
Yet religious realisation does all the good to the world. People 
are afraid that when they attain to it, when they realise that there 
is but one, the fountains of love will be dried up, that everything 
in life will go away, and that all they love will vanish for them, 
as it were, in this life and in the life to come. People never stop 
to think that those who bestowed the least thought on their own 
individualities have been the greatest workers in the world. 
Then alone a man loves when he finds that the object of his love 
is not any low, little, mortal thing. Then alone a man loves when 
he finds that the object of his love is not a clod of earth, but it is 
the veritable God Himself. The wife will love the husband the

more when she thinks that the husband is God Himself. The 
husband will love the wife the more when he knows that the 
wife is God Himself. That mother will love the children more 
who thinks that the children are God Himself. 
 
That man will love his greatest enemy who knows that that very 
enemy is God Himself. That man will love a holy man who 
knows that the holy man is God Himself, and that very man will 
also love the unholiest of men because he knows the background 
of that unholiest of men is even He, the Lord. Such a man 
becomes a world-mover for whom his little self is dead and God 
stands in its place. The whole universe will become transfigured 
to him. That which is painful and miserable will all vanish; 
struggles will all depart and go. 
 
Instead of being a prison-house, where we every day struggle 
and fight and compete for a morsel of bread, this universe will 
then be to us a playground. Beautiful will be this universe then! 
Such a man alone has the right to stand up and say, "How 
beautiful is this world!" He alone has the right to say that it is 
all good. This will be the great good to the world resulting from 
such realisation, that instead of this world going on with all its 
friction and clashing, if all mankind today realise only a bit of 
that great truth, the aspect of the whole world will be changed, 
and, in place of fighting and quarrelling, there would be a reign 
of peace. This indecent and brutal hurry which forces us to go 
ahead of every one else will then vanish from the world. With it 
will vanish all struggle, with it will vanish all hate, with it will 


 
 
119 
 
vanish all jealousy, and all evil will vanish away for ever. Gods 
will live then upon this earth. This very earth will then become 
heaven, and what evil can there be when gods are playing with 
gods, when gods are working with gods, and gods are loving 
gods? That is the great utility of divine realisation.  
 
Everything that you see in society will be changed and 
transfigured then. No more will you think of man as evil; and 
that is the first great gain. No more will you stand up and 
sneeringly cast a glance at a poor man or woman who has made 
a mistake. No more, ladies, will you look down with contempt 
upon the poor woman who walks the street in the night, because 
you will see even there God Himself.  
 
No more will you think of jealousy and punishments. They will 
all vanish; and love, the great ideal of love, will be so powerful 
that no whip and cord will be necessary to guide mankind aright. 
If one millionth part of the men and women who live in this 
world simply sit down and for a few minutes say, "You are all 
God, O ye men and O ye animals and living beings, you are all 
the manifestations of the one living Deity!" the whole world will 
be changed in half an hour. Instead of throwing tremendous 
bomb-shells of hatred into every corner, instead of projecting 
currents of jealousy and of evil thought, in every country people 
will think that it is all He. 
 
He is all that you see and feel. How can you see evil until there 
is evil in you? How can you see the thief, unless he is there, 


 
 
120 
 
sitting in the heart of your heart? How can you see the murderer 
until you are yourself the murderer?  
 
Be good, and evil will vanish for you. The whole universe will 
thus be changed. This is the greatest gain to society. This is the 
great gain to the human organism. 
 
These thoughts were thought out, worked out amongst 
individuals in ancient times in India. For various reasons, such 
as the exclusiveness of the teachers and foreign conquest, those 
thoughts were not allowed to spread. Yet they are grand truths; 
and wherever they have been working, man has become divine. 
My whole life has been changed by the touch of one of these 
divine men, about whom I am going to speak to you next 
Sunday; and the time is coming when these thoughts will be 
cast abroad over the whole world. 
 
Instead of living in monasteries, instead of being confined to 
books of philosophy to be studied only by the learned, instead 
of being the exclusive possession of sects and of a few of the 
learned, they will all be sown broadcast over the whole world, 
so that they may become the common property of the saint and 
the sinner, of men and women and children, of the learned and 
of the ignorant. They will then permeate the atmosphere of the 
world, and the very air that we breathe will say with every one 
of its pulsations, "Thou art That". And the whole universe with 
its myriads of suns and moons, through everything that speaks, 
with one voice will say, "Thou-art-That".
