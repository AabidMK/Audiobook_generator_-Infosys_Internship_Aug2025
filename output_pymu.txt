1. Representation of Knowledge  
Human beings are good at understanding, reasoning and interpreting knowledge. And using 
this knowledge, they are able to perform various actions in the real world. But how do 
machines perform the same?  
What is Knowledge Representation?   
Knowledge Representation (KR) describes the representation of knowledge. Basically, it is a 
study of how the beliefs, intentions, and judgments of an intelligent agent can be expressed 
suitably for automated reasoning. One of the primary purposes of Knowledge 
Representation includes modelling intelligent behaviour for an agent.   
Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KRR) represents information from the real world 
for a computer to understand and then utilize this knowledge to solve complex real-life 
problems like communicating with human beings in natural language.   
KRR is not just about storing data in a database, it allows a machine to learn from that 
knowledge and behave intelligently like a human being.   
The different kinds of knowledge that need to be represented in AI include: –   
• Objects  
• Events   
• Performance   
• Facts   
• Meta-Knowledge   
• Knowledge-base   
Types of Knowledge   

---page2---
  
• Declarative Knowledge – It includes concepts, facts, and objects and expressed in a 
declarative sentence.  
• Structural Knowledge – It is a basic problem-solving knowledge that describes the 
relationship between concepts and objects.   
• Procedural Knowledge – This is responsible for knowing how to do something and 
includes rules, strategies, procedures, etc.   
• Meta Knowledge – Meta Knowledge defines knowledge about other types of 
Knowledge.   
• Heuristic Knowledge – This represents some expert knowledge in the field or subject.   
Cycle of Knowledge Representation in AI  
Artificial Intelligent Systems usually consist of various components to display their intelligent 
behavior. Some of these components include:   
• Perception  
• Learning   
• Knowledge Representation & Reasoning   
• Planning   
• Execution

Example:   
  
• The Perception component retrieves data or information from the environment.   
• with the help of this component, you can retrieve data from the environment, find 
out the source of noises and check if the AI was damaged by anything.   
• Also, it defines how to respond when any sense has been detected. Example  
• Then, there is the Learning Component that learns from the captured data by the 
perception component.   
• The goal is to build computers that can be taught instead of programming them. 
Learning focuses on the process of self-improvement.   
• In order to learn new things, the system requires knowledge acquisition, inference, 
acquisition of heuristics, faster searches, etc.   
• The main component in the cycle is Knowledge Representation and Reasoning which 
shows the humanlike intelligence in the machines.   
• Knowledge representation is all about understanding intelligence.   
• Instead of trying to understand or build brains from the bottom up, its goal is to 
understand and build intelligent behavior from the top-down and focus on what an 
agent needs to know in order to behave intelligently.
