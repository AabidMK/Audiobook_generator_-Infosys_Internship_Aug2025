## Chapter 1: The Feast

The scene: Hamilcar's gardens in Megara, a Carthaginian suburb.  His Sicilian veterans feasted, celebrating the Eryx battle anniversary.  Their master absent, the numerous soldiers ate and drank freely.

Captains, in bronze greaves, sat beneath a purple awning fringed with gold.  Rank-and-file soldiers sprawled beneath trees, overlooking various structures: wine-presses, cellars, storehouses, bakeries, arsenals, elephant stables, animal dens, and a slave prison.

Fig trees surrounded the kitchens.  A sycamore grove met lush vegetation—pomegranates among cotton plants, grape-laden vines climbing pines, roses blooming beneath plane trees, lilies swaying on the turf. Paths were strewn with black sand and coral dust. A cypress avenue formed a green colonnade.

In the distance stood the palace, its four terraced stories of yellow Numidian marble.  Its ebony staircase, adorned with galley prows, red doors marked with black crosses, brass scorpion guards, and gilded trellises, seemed as imposing and impenetrable as Hamilcar himself.

The Council had granted the palace for the feast. Convalescents from the Eschmoun temple had arrived at dawn, hobbling on crutches.  More arrived constantly, flooding in like torrents.  Kitchen slaves scurried, half-naked and panicked. Gazelles fled bleating. As the sun set, the scent of citron mingled with the soldiers' sweat.

Soldiers of every nation were present: Ligurians, Lusitanians, Balearians, Negroes, and Roman deserters.  Their languages clashed—Dorian, Celtic, Ionian, and harsh desert tongues.  Each soldier's origin was evident: the Greek's slender frame, the Egyptian's high shoulders, the Cantabrian's broad calves.  Carians proudly displayed their plumes, Cappadocians showed off herbal body art, and Lydians dined in women's robes.  Some wore vermilion, resembling coral statues.

They feasted, sprawling on cushions, squatting around trays, or lying face down, tearing meat like lions. Latecomers leaned against trees, awaiting their turn.

Hamilcar's kitchens proved insufficient. The Council provided extra slaves, dishes, and beds.  Large fires blazed, roasting oxen, mirroring a battlefield pyre.  Anise loaves, massive cheeses, wine-filled crateras, water cantharuses, and filigree baskets of flowers adorned the scene.  Eyes gleamed with the joy of unrestrained feasting; songs began.

The meal began with birds and green sauce, followed by shellfish, porridge, beans, barley, and cumin-spiced snails.  Then came the main course: antelope, peacock, sheep in sweet wine, camel and buffalo haunches, hedgehogs with garum, fried grasshoppers, and preserved dormice.  Fat floated in saffron.  Wine, truffles, and asafoetida overflowed.  Fruit pyramids crumbled onto honeycombs.  Even plump, olive-lees-fed dogs—a Carthaginian delicacy—were served.  The unusual fare sparked ravenous appetites.  Gauls devoured watermelons and lemons, rind included.  Negroes struggled with lobster spines.  Greeks fastidiously discarded leftovers.  Brutian herdsmen silently devoured their portions.

Night fell. The awning was retracted; torches were lit. Apes, sacred to the moon, shrieked at the flickering petroleum flames in porphyry vases, amusing the soldiers.  Torches reflected in brass cuirasses. Gem-encrusted dishes glittered.  Mirrors on crateras multiplied images.  Soldiers tossed stools and spatulas. They drank Greek, Campanian, Cantabrian, jujube, cinnamomum, and lotus wines, spilling pools onto the ground.  The air filled with smoke and breath.  The sounds of jaws snapping, voices raised, songs, and clinking cups mingled with the shattering of vases and the chime of silver dishes.

Their intoxication fueled resentment towards Carthage. The war-exhausted Republic had allowed returning troops to overcrowd the city. General Gisco had dispersed them to ease pay distribution, hoping for pay reductions.  However, unpaid wages fueled anger, conflating the Republic's debt with the 3200 Euboic talents exacted by Lutatius.  The mercenaries felt betrayed, viewing both the Republic and Rome as enemies.

Their anger erupted in threats. They demanded a victory celebration; the peace party acquiesced, partly to spite Hamilcar, a war proponent.  Hamilcar, despairing of Carthage, had left mercenary governance to Gisco.  Hosting the feast in his palace drew mercenary hatred upon him.  The expense was enormous, falling largely on him.

The mercenaries, proud of forcing the Republic's submission, expected payment for their service.  Yet, through drunken haze, their hardships seemed immense and poorly rewarded. They showed wounds, recounted battles, travels, and hunts. They mimicked animals.  Unseemly bets were made. They drank incessantly. A gigantic Lusitanian carried men aloft, spitting fire.  Lacedaemonians leaped in their cuirasses. Some acted obscenely; others stripped to fight. Greeks danced around a vase; a Negro beat a buckler.

Then, a plaintive song arose—a wounded bird's wingbeat. It was the slaves in the ergastulum. Soldiers sprang up, freeing them.

They returned, driving twenty pale slaves through the dust.  Their shaven heads were covered in small black felt caps; wooden shoes made a metallic clang. They entered the cypress avenue, lost in the questioning crowd. One slave remained, his scarred shoulders showing through his torn tunic.  He looked around distrustfully, then sighed, stammered, and wept. He raised a cantharus, chains dangling from his arms, and prayed to Baal-Eshmoun, fountain, wood, and mountain spirits, and the soldiers who freed him.

He was Spendius. Captured at Aeginusae, he thanked the mercenaries in Greek, Ligurian, and Punic, kissing their hands. He marveled at the banquet, noting the absence of the Sacred Legion's cups.  These emerald-vine-adorned golden cups were a privilege of young patrician legionaries, highly coveted by the mercenaries.

The mercenaries demanded the cups.  They were held by the Syssitia, sleeping traders.  The slaves returned, explaining the cups were locked in a temple.

"Open it!" the mercenaries roared.

The slaves revealed Gisco, the general, possessed the cups.

"Bring them!" they demanded.


Gisco arrived, escorted by the Sacred Legion.  His black cloak, golden mitre, and triple necklace were visible in the night.  The soldiers shouted for the cups.

Gisco praised their courage, but declared the cups were private property. A Gaul lunged at Gisco, brandishing swords.  Gisco struck him down with his staff.  The Gauls howled, threatening to overwhelm the legionaries.  Gisco, seeing his efforts futile, withdrew, vowing revenge.


The feast resumed, but the threat of Gisco's return loomed.  Surrounding the suburb, he could crush them against the walls.  The sleeping city below filled them with fear.  Distant ship lanterns and temple lights flickered.  They thought of Hamilcar, wondering why he abandoned them after the peace.  Their anger turned on him; they cursed him.

They gathered, witnessing a slave convulsing, foaming at the mouth—poisoned, someone cried.  Panic ensued.  They attacked the slaves, a destructive frenzy engulfing the drunken army.  They struck wildly, smashing and killing, setting fire to trees.  They slaughtered lions and aimed to kill elephants for ivory.


Balearic slingers, seeking plunder, found themselves in another palace garden, filled with manicured vegetation and white flowers forming parabolas.  Gloomy bushes exhaled sweet scents; cinnabar-smeared tree trunks resembled bloody columns.  Twelve pedestals held glass balls filled with reddish light—gigantic, pulsing eyeballs.


They discovered a lake, divided into basins by blue stones.  Torches flickered in its depths, revealing white pebbles and golden dust.  It bubbled; jeweled fish appeared.  These were the Barca family fish, descendants of the goddess's mystic egg.


The mercenaries, remembering the sacrilege, boiled the fish.  Fear vanished; they drank again.  Their tunics soaked with sweat and perfume, they devoured the remaining feast with their eyes.  They smashed dishes and furniture.  Songs mingled with the death rattles of dying slaves.  They demanded wine, meat, gold, and women.  They raved in many languages, some mistaking the steam for bathhouses, others imagining a hunt.  The fire spread, consuming trees.  The wounded lions roared.


The palace's highest terrace lit up.  Hamilcar's daughter, Salammbo, appeared, clad in black.  She descended the staircase, stopping at the galley staircase.  She gazed at the soldiers.


Two pale eunuch priests, in white, red-fringed robes, followed, carrying lyres, singing a hymn to Carthage's divinity.


Salammbo descended, the priests behind her. She walked slowly through the captains' tables.  Her violet-sand-powdered hair was styled like a tower.  Pearls adorned her temples, her lips were rosy.  Luminous stones on her breast resembled a murena's scales.  Diamonds adorned her arms, bare from her black, red-flowered tunic.  A golden chainlet regulated her steps; her purple mantle trailed behind her.


The priests played mournful chords.  The chain tinkled; her papyrus sandals pattered.  She was known for her piety, seen kneeling before the stars.  The moon had bleached her skin; a divine aura surrounded her.  Her gaze seemed distant.  She carried a small ebony lyre, murmuring:


"Dead! All dead! You will not obey my voice, as when I fed you watermelon seeds. Tanith's mystery shone in your eyes."  She called them by the names of months: "Siv! Sivan! Tammouz, Eloul, Tischri, Schebar! Ah! have pity on me, goddess!"


Soldiers thronged around, awestruck.  She looked at them fearfully, waving her arms:


"What have you done? You had bread, meat, oil, malobathrum! I brought oxen, sent hunters!" Her voice rose; her cheeks flushed.  "Where are you? In a conquered town?  Hamilcar, my father, the Baals' servant, withheld your arms from Lutatius!  His slaves' blood stains them red!  Burn this palace! I will carry my house's spirit, my black serpent, with me!"


Her nostrils quivered; she crushed her nails against her gems.  Her eyes drooped:


"Ah! Carthage! You no longer have the strong men of old! All lands labored for you! The sea rocked with your harvests."


She sang of Melkarth, her ancestor, his ascent of Ersiphonia, journey to Tartessus, and war against Masisabal:


"He pursued the monster, whose tail undulated like a silver brook.  Blood-red moon shone; scarlet tongues curled to the flame."


She sang of Melkarth placing Masisabal's head on his ship's prow:


"It sank beneath the foam, but the sun embalmed it; it became harder than gold; yet the eyes wept continually."


She sang in Canaanite, unintelligible to the Barbarians. They watched her, straining to grasp her story. Only the priests understood, their hands trembling with mystic emotion and fear.


A young Numidian chief watched her intently. His dart-laden girdle bulged beneath his cloak.  His face was shadowed, only his eyes visible.  He was there due to a custom of royal children lodging with great families to foster alliances. Narr' Havas had lived with the Barcas six months without seeing Salammbo. He watched her like a crouching leopard.


A colossal Libyan, in a blood-stained jacket, watched with a smile.


Salammbo abandoned the sacred rhythm, using various dialects to soothe them.  She spoke Greek to the Greeks, Ligurian to the Ligurians, and so on.  She sang of Carthage's battles against Rome; they applauded.  She raised her arms, then fell silent, enjoying their agitation.


Matho, the Libyan, leaned towards her.  She poured him wine, seeking to appease the army.


"Drink!" she said.


As he raised the cup, the Gaul Gisco injured struck him.  Spendius offered to translate the Gaul's jovial words:


"The gods protect you; you'll be rich.  When's the wedding?"


"What wedding?" Matho asked.


"Yours! When a woman gives a soldier drink, she offers her bed."


Narr' Havas hurled a javelin, pinning Matho's arm to the cloth.  Matho pulled it out, weaponless. He overturned a table, sending it at Narr' Havas.  A struggle ensued.  Matho fought, his head a weapon.  Narr' Havas vanished.  Salammbo was gone.


Matho saw the palace door and fled. He ran, reaching the door, collapsing against the wall.  Spendius followed.


"Go!" Matho said.


Spendius tore his tunic, then knelt, tending Matho's wound.  He saw a gaping wound.  He bound it.


"Leave me!" Matho said.


"No! You freed me. I am yours! Command me!" Spendius replied.


Matho paced, peering into the palace.


"Listen! I know the palace.  The Ancestor's Chamber holds gold under each flagstone.  A path leads to their tombs."


"What matters it?" Matho said.


They stood on the terrace.  Darkness stretched before them.  Dawn broke.  Megara's canals striped the gardens.  Temples, staircases, and ramparts emerged.  Foam rocked around Carthage.  Houses resembled black goats descending mountains.  Streets lengthened; palm trees stood still; cisterns gleamed.  Eshmoun's horses neighed towards the rising sun.


The sun rose, bathing Carthage in gold.  Galleys glittered; Khamon's roof blazed.  Chariots rolled; dromedaries descended ramps.  Money-changers opened shops; storks flew; sails fluttered.  Tanith's sacred courtesans played tambourines.


Spendius chattered:


"Ah! yes—master! I understand why you scorned the palace plunder."


Matho seemed startled.


"What riches!  And they lack the steel to defend them!" Spendius said, pointing to people searching for gold dust.  "The Republic is like them—greedy, deaf to the master's heel!"


He showed Matho the soldiers' swords, gleaming like mirrors.


"Here are strong men, hating Carthage, unbound by family, oaths, or gods!"


Matho leaned against the wall.  Spendius whispered:


"We'll wear purple, bathe in perfume, have slaves!  Are you tired of hard ground, camp vinegar, the trumpet?  They'll cast your corpse to vultures!  Or you'll be blind, lame, begging!  Remember the injustice, snow, sun, tyranny, the cross!  They gave you an honor necklace like bells on an ass!  You, braver than Pyrrhus!  Carthage is ours! Attack!"


"No!" Matho said.  "Moloch's curse weighs on me.  I saw a black ram."  He looked around.  "Where is she?"


Spendius saw his unease and fell silent.  Trees smoked; apes fell among dishes.  Soldiers snored near corpses.  The ground was blood-soaked.  Elephants trumpeted.  Wheat spilled from granaries.  Peacocks cried.


Matho's immobility surprised Spendius.  He gazed at a golden speck—a chariot drawn by mules, carrying two women.  Spendius recognized them and stifled a cry. A large veil billowed behind.


## Chapter 2: At Sicca

Two days later, the mercenaries left Carthage, each receiving a gold coin, ordered to camp at Sicca.  They were lauded as saviors, but told to leave to prevent Carthage's insolvency.  Taxes would be levied; full pay and transport home promised.  They left through the Khamon street and Cirta gate, a chaotic mix of soldiers.  They marched boldly, their damaged armor and sunburnt faces grim.  They filled the streets, overflowing between tall houses.  Veiled women watched from behind gratings.


Carthaginians, clad in black, crowded the terraces and walls.  Sailors' tunics were blood-red spots in the dark mass.  Children gesticulated.  Elderly figures stood dreamily on towers.  Anxiety gripped the Carthaginians; they feared the mercenaries' strength.  Yet, the mercenaries' departure seemed genuine, leading Carthaginians to mingle, showering them with embraces, perfumes, flowers, silver, amulets, and curses.


The baggage train followed—sick on dromedaries, drunkards with wineskins, greedy soldiers with food, those with parasols and parrots, and animals.  Libyan women rode asses, scolding Negresses who left brothels for soldiers.  Mules strained under tents.  Emaciated servants and water carriers, the city's dregs, trailed behind.


The gates closed.  The army spread across the isthmus, breaking into groups.  Lances resembled grass blades; dust trails obscured them.  Those looking back saw Carthage's walls against the sky.


A shout arose.  They thought some had remained to plunder a temple.  They laughed, continuing their march.  They rejoiced at their freedom, some Greeks singing the Mamertine song:


"I plough and reap! I'm master! The disarmed fall at my feet!"


They shouted, leaped, told stories.  At Tunis, they noticed missing Balearic slingers, but continued.  Some lodged in houses; others camped.  Townspeople chatted with them.  Carthage's fires burned all night.


The next day, they marched through cultivated lands, passing patrician estates, palm groves, olive trees, and blue mountains.  A warm wind blew; chameleons crawled.


Their pace slowed.  They ate grapes, rested, marveling at the oxen's horns, sheep in protective skins, lozenge-shaped furrows, ploughshares like anchors, and silphium-watered pomegranates.  They slept under the stars, regretting Hamilcar's feast.


They halted by a river, bathing and drinking.  Spendius, on a stolen dromedary, saw Matho giving his mule water.  He called, "Master! Master!"


Matho barely acknowledged him, but Spendius followed, glancing towards Carthage.  Spendius, son of a Greek rhetor and Campanian prostitute, had dealt in women, been shipwrecked, fought Romans, been captured and escaped repeatedly, worked in quarries, endured torture, and attempted suicide.  Hamilcar's sailors rescued him, placing him in the Megara ergastulum.  He escaped with the soldiers.


He served Matho, bringing food and comfort.  Matho, a Libyan born in Syrtis, had pilgrimaged to Ammon, hunted elephants, served Carthage, and become a tetrarch.  He owed Carthage four horses, wheat, and pay.  He feared the gods and longed for home.


Spendius recounted his travels and knowledge—sandal-making, hunting, cooking.  He'd cry out, startling Matho's mule; then resume, his agony subsiding on the fourth day.


They marched, the plain stretching before them.  Mountains seemed to shift.  Rivers appeared and disappeared.  Rocks resembled ship prows or colossi.  They passed quadrangular temples, pilgrim stations, closed like tombs.  Libyans battered the doors.


Cultivation thinned.  They entered sandy thickets.  A woman fled at their approach.  They entered a passage between reddish hills, smelling something foul.  A lion's head appeared—a crucified lion.


They found more crucified lions—some skeletons, others grotesquely contorted, some enormous, their crosses bending.  Crows circled.  Carthaginian peasants crucified captured lions to deter others.  The mercenaries' laughter ceased; they were awestruck.


They felt uneasy, sick, and weary.  Aloes thorns scratched their hands; mosquitoes buzzed; dysentery spread.  They feared the desert.  Some turned back.


On the seventh day, they turned, seeing Sicca's walls on white rocks.  Tanith's priestesses appeared on the walls, playing instruments, their naked arms stretched over lyres.  Their instruments would fall silent; then a frenzied cry would erupt.  Others watched impassively.


Sicca couldn't hold the multitude; the temple occupied half the city.  The mercenaries camped on the plain, organizing by nationality.  Greeks formed lines; Iberians made circles; Gauls built plank huts; Libyans used stones; Negroes dug trenches.  Many slept on the ground.


The plain was surrounded by mountains.  Palm trees leaned on sand hills; pines and oaks dotted the precipices.  Rain sometimes hung like a scarf; then dust storms arose.  Sicca's golden-roofed, brass-columned temple of Venus dominated the landscape.


Spendius, having bought a slave, slept before Matho's tent, sometimes dreaming of the lash, smiling at his scars.  Matho accepted his company.  Spendius escorted him, Matho resting on his shoulder.


They saw Narr' Havas, the Numidian prince, among men in white cloaks.  Matho wanted to kill him.


"Not yet," Spendius said.  Narr' Havas kissed Matho's thumbs in alliance, speaking against Carthage, his motives unclear.  Spendius hoped to profit from any disorder.


Narr' Havas courted Matho, sending gifts.  Matho was uncertain, but Spendius guided him.  Matho remained listless.


On a lion hunt, Narr' Havas concealed a dagger, but didn't use it.  Another time, Narr' Havas led them astray, but Spendius found the way.


Matho wandered, consulting soothsayers, swallowing herbs and poisons, undergoing rituals.  He buried a name in the sand.  Spendius heard his groans.


One night, Spendius found Matho naked, on a lion skin, weeping.


"It's the gods' wrath! Salammbo pursues me! I fear her!"


"What's wrong?" Spendius asked.


"The gods' wrath!  She pursues me!  Her eyes burn me; I hear her voice!  She's my soul! Yet, an ocean separates us!  She's inaccessible! Her beauty is a cloud of light!  I think I've never seen her—that she doesn't exist!"


Matho wept.  Spendius, remembering his courtesans, felt pity:


"Be strong!  Summon your will!  Don't beseech the gods!  Are you humiliated by a woman?"


"Am I a child?  I've embraced women amidst assaults! But she…"


"If she weren't Hanno's daughter…" Spendius began.


"No!  Her eyes are like suns beneath arches!  When she appeared, torches paled!  Her breast shone!  Her being was sweeter than wine, more terrible than death.  She walked, then stopped."


"I want her! I need her! I'm dying for her! I hate her! I want to beat her! I'd be her slave! You saw her! Speak of her! She ascends her terrace!  Stars bend to see her!"


He fell into a frenzy.  He sang Melkarth's pursuit of the monster.  He imitated Salammbo's voice.


Spendius's consolations were useless.  Their nights were filled with his lamentations.


Matho drank to forget, becoming more melancholy.  He gambled away his necklace.  He consulted the goddess's servants, returning sobbing.


Spendius grew bolder, socializing, mending armor, juggling, gathering herbs.  He became popular.


They awaited an ambassador with gold.  They planned their futures—concubines, slaves, lands.  But idleness fueled disputes.  Debtors and outlaws arrived.  Traders blamed the Republic.  Spendius incited them.  Provisions dwindled; they considered attacking Carthage and calling in the Romans.


One evening, a purple litter arrived, adorned with feathers.  Camels with bells and horsemen in golden scale armor followed.  They dismounted, revealing Hanno, the Suffet, his face pale and bloated.


The soldiers recognized Hanno, whose negligence contributed to the Aegatian Islands' defeat.  He'd claimed captive deaths at Hecatompylos, selling them instead.


Hanno, supported by slaves, addressed the soldiers.  He praised the gods and Republic, urging reasonableness.  He used proverbs, nodding for approval.  No one understood.


He summoned the captains.  Herolds shouted the order in Greek.  Guards dispersed the crowd.  Captains arrived.  Night fell; fires burned; soldiers questioned the lack of money.


Hanno detailed the Republic's burdens—empty treasury, Roman tribute.  He rubbed himself with his spatula, drank a ptisan, and continued.  He described the Republic's financial woes—high prices, abandoned lands, depleted fisheries, lack of spices and silphium, and fewer slaves.


The captains didn't understand Punic.  Interpreters were absent.  Hanno's voice was lost in the wind.  Greeks strained to hear; mountaineers yawned; Gauls sneered; desert men listened impassively.  The crowd pressed; Negroes held torches.  Hanno continued.


The Barbarians grew impatient.  Murmurs arose.  Spendius seized a trumpet, announcing an important message in five languages.  The captains told him to speak.


Spendius, trembling, addressed the Libyans:


"You heard his threats!"


Hanno didn't react; he didn't understand Libyan.  Spendius repeated in other dialects.  They nodded.


Spendius declared Hanno called their gods dreams, called them cowards, thieves, liars, and dogs, claiming they drained the Republic's resources and were in league with Cyrenian nomads.  He said they'd be punished—forced to work.

# Chapter 3: Salammbo

The moon, rising above the waves, cast luminous specks across the sleeping city: a chariot pole, a linen rag, a wall corner, a god's golden necklace. Temple roof-balls gleamed like diamonds.  Dark ruins, earth, and gardens filled the gloom. Below Malqua, fishermen's nets stretched like giant bat wings.  The hydraulic wheels were still; camels rested peacefully. Porters slept in the streets. Colossal shadows stretched across deserted squares.  Distant sacrificial smoke escaped through bronze tiles, mingling with sea scents and sun-baked walls.  Motionless waves shone around Carthage. Moonlight bathed the gulf and Tunis lake, where flamingoes formed rose-colored lines. The salt lagoon shimmered like silver. The sky met the dusty plains and misty sea.  On the Acropolis, cypress trees swayed like waves against the ramparts.

Salammbo ascended her palace terrace, supported by a slave bearing live coals.  A small ivory bed, covered in lynx skins and parrot-feather cushions, sat at the center.  Four perfuming-pans, filled with nard, incense, cinnamomum, and myrrh, stood at its corners. The slave lit the perfumes. Salammbo gazed at the North Star, saluted the heavens, and knelt in the azure dust strewn with golden stars.  She threw back her head, arms outstretched:

* “O Rabetna!—Baalet!—Tanith! Anaitis! Astarte! Derceto! Astoreth! Mylitta! Athara! Elissa! Tiratha! By hidden symbols, resounding sistra, earth's furrows, eternal silence and fruitfulness—mistress of the gloomy sea and azure shores, O Queen of the watery world, all hail!”

She swayed, then fell face down. The slave quickly raised her; catching the supplicant signified divine acceptance.  This slave, Tanaach, had been brought from Gaetulia.  After her enfranchisement, she remained loyal, a fact evident from her pierced ear.  Her multicolored petticoat fell to her ankles, where tin rings clashed. Her flat face was yellow, matching her tunic. Long silver bodkins formed a sun behind her head. A coral button adorned her nostril. She stood beside the bed, erect and demure.

Salammbo gazed at the horizon, then the sleeping city. A sigh swelled her bosom, rippling her long white simar.  Emerald-covered sandals hid beneath her hair, held by a purple net. She looked to the moon:

* “How lightly you turn, supported by impalpable ether! Your agitation distributes winds and dews.  As you wax and wane, cats' eyes and panthers' spots change. Wives cry your name in childbirth! You swell shells, bubble wine, and putrefy corpses! You form sea pearls! Every germ ferments in your dark depths. When you appear, quietness spreads; flowers close, waves soothe, weary man stretches towards you, and the world sees itself in your face. You are white, gentle, luminous, immaculate, helping, purifying, serene!”

The moon's crescent hung above the Hot Springs mountain.  A small star shone within its pale circle. Salammbo continued:

* “But you are a terrible mistress! Monsters, phantoms, and lying dreams come from you; your eyes devour stones, apes sicken when you grow young. Whither do you go? Why change forms? Now, slender and curved, you glide like a galley; then, amid stars, you are a shepherd. Shining and round, you graze mountain-tops like a chariot wheel. O Tanith, do you love me? I have gazed upon you so much! But no! You sail through your azure, and I—I remain on the motionless earth.”

“Taanach, play softly,” Salammbo murmured.

The slave played her ebony harp, its sounds like buzzing bees, mingling with waves and rustling trees.

* “Hush!” cried Salammbo.
* “Mistress, what troubles you?”
* “I don’t know.  I long to dissolve in prayer like a flower in wine.”
* “Perhaps the perfume smoke?”
* “No! The gods' spirit dwells in fragrance.”

Tanaach spoke of Salammbo's father, believed to be in the amber country.  She advised Salammbo to choose a husband among the Ancients. Salammbo recoiled; their laughter and limbs horrified her.

* “Sometimes, hot fumes exhale from me, heavier than volcanic vapors. Voices call; a globe of fire rolls within me, stifling me. Then, something sweet flows through me—a caress—and I feel crushed, as if a god were upon me. Oh, to lose myself in night's mists, fountain waters, tree sap! To leave my body, be a breath, a ray, and glide to you, Mother!”

She raised her arms, her pale form like the moon. She fell back panting. Tanaach placed an amber necklace around her neck.

* “Bring me Schahabarim,” Salammbo whispered.

Her father had kept her from the priestesses, reserving her for political alliance. Salammbo lived alone, her mother long dead.  She lived a life of abstinence, fasting, and purification, surrounded by exquisite things, her body saturated with perfume, her soul filled with prayer. She knew nothing of obscene images; she worshipped Tanith's sidereal aspect.  The moon's phases affected her; she weakened when it waned, reviving at evening. An eclipse nearly killed her. Rabetna, jealous of her untouched virginity, tormented her with vague possessions.  Salammbo studied Tanith's adventures and names, seeking deeper understanding of the goddess. She longed to see the idol in the temple.

Salammbo turned; she recognized Schahabarim's golden bells. He entered, stopping at the threshold. His sunken eyes shone like sepulchral lamps. His thin body floated in his linen robe, weighted by bells and emeralds.  He was frail, with an oblique skull and pointed chin; his skin felt cold. His wrinkled yellow face seemed perpetually grieved. He was Tanith's high priest, Salammbo's tutor.

* “Speak! What do you want?”
* “I hoped…you promised…” Salammbo stammered. “Why despise me? What have I forgotten in the rites? You are my master, and you said none were as accomplished as I, yet you won’t speak of some things. Is it so, father?”

Schahabarim, remembering Hamilcar's orders, replied:

* “No, I have nothing more to teach you.”

* “A genius impels me to this love. I’ve climbed Eschmoun’s steps, slept beneath Melkarth’s olive, opened Baal-Khamon’s doors, sacrificed to the Kabiri, gods of woods, winds, rivers, and mountains. But they are too far, too high, too insensible.  I feel her mingled in my life; she fills my soul, and I quiver as if she were leaping to escape. I’m about to hear her voice, see her face; lightnings dazzle me, then I sink back into darkness.”

Schahabarim was silent. Salammbo pleaded. He dismissed Tanaach.  Raising an arm, he began:

* “Before the gods, only darkness was, a dull breathing like a man’s dream-conscience. It contracted, creating Desire and Cloud; from them issued primitive Matter—muddy, black, icy water. It contained senseless monsters, incoherent forms, painted on sanctuary walls. Matter condensed, became an egg, burst. One half formed earth, the other firmament. Sun, moon, winds, and clouds appeared; intelligent creatures awoke. Eschmoun spread in the starry sphere; Khamon beamed in the sun; Melkarth stretched behind Gades; the Kabiri descended beneath volcanoes; Rabetna, like a nurse, bent over the world, pouring out light like milk, her night like a mantle.”

* “And then?”

He’d diverted her from higher aspirations, but her desire rekindled. Schahabarim, yielding slightly, resumed:

* “She inspires and governs men’s loves.”
* “Men’s loves!” Salammbo echoed dreamily.
* “She is Carthage’s soul; though everywhere diffused, she dwells here, beneath the sacred veil.”
* “Father! I shall see her? You’ll bring me to her! I’ve hesitated; I’m devoured by curiosity. Pity! Help me! Let us go!”

He vehemently repulsed her.

* “Never! Do you not know it means death? The hermaphrodite Baals are unveiled only to us who are men in understanding and women in weakness. Your desire is sacrilege; be content with your knowledge!”

She knelt, touching her ears in repentance. Crushed, angry, terrified, and humiliated, she sobbed. Schahabarim remained unmoved. He felt joy in her suffering for his divinity. Birds sang; a cold wind blew; clouds drifted. He saw mists on the horizon—the Barbarian army advancing on Carthage.


# Chapter 4: Beneath the Walls of Carthage

Country folk, riding asses or running, arrived in Carthage, pale, breathless, terrified. They fled the approaching army, which had marched from Sicca in three days to annihilate Carthage. The gates were shut. The Barbarians appeared, halting on the isthmus's edge.

Initially, they made no hostile advance. Some approached with palm branches, but were driven back by arrows.  Morning and night, prowlers appeared along the walls—a cloaked man with a low visor, gazing intently at the aqueduct, and a giant, bareheaded.

Carthage’s defenses spanned the isthmus: a trench, a grassy rampart, and a thirty-cubit-high, two-story freestone wall. It housed stables for three hundred elephants, four thousand horses, and barracks for twenty thousand soldiers. Towers rose from the second story, equipped with battlements and bronze bucklers.

This wall protected Malqua, the sailors' and dyers' quarter. Purple sails dried on masts; clay furnaces heated pickle on terraces.  Behind, lofty houses rose in a cubic amphitheater, built of stone, planks, reeds, shells, and earth. Temple woods were green lakes in this multicolored mountain, leveled by squares and cut by countless lanes.  The three old quarters, now lost, rose like reefs or extended in blackened, flower-covered fronts, with streets passing through like rivers.

Byrsa's Acropolis was a jumble of monuments: temples with bronze capitals and chains, stone cones, copper cupolas, marble architraves, Babylonian buttresses, and obelisks. Peristyles met pediments; volutes appeared through colonnades; granite walls supported tile partitions.  The Acropolis showed the passage of ages and forgotten homelands.

Behind the Acropolis, the Mappalian road, lined with tombs, stretched to the catacombs.  Spacious dwellings dotted Megara, the new town, extending to the cliff's edge, where a giant pharos blazed nightly.

The Barbarians saw Carthage's markets and crossways, debating temple locations: Khamon's, facing the Syssitia, had golden tiles; Melkarth, left of Eschmoun, had coral; Tanith's copper cupola swelled among palm trees; Moloch stood below the cisterns, towards the pharos.  Colossal or squat divinities, with hideous heads, enormous bellies, or flattened forms, stood everywhere, holding forks, chains, or javelins. The blue sea stretched behind steep streets, filled with a tumultuous people. Boys rang bells; shops smoked; anvils rang; sacred cocks crowed; oxen bellowed; slaves ran; priests appeared in dark cloaks and pointed caps.

Carthage irritated the Barbarians; they admired and execrated it, wanting both to destroy and inhabit it.  They saw the Military Harbour, defended by a triple wall, and beyond, Hamilcar's palace, which constantly drew Matho's gaze. He climbed olive trees, scanning the empty gardens and the shut red door.  He circled the ramparts, seeking an entrance. One night, he swam to the Mappalian quarter, trying to climb the cliff, injuring himself badly before retreating.

His impotence enraged him; he envied Carthage for possessing Salammbo.  His nervelessness turned to frantic action. He strode through camp, or sat on the shore, scouring his sword. He shot arrows at vultures.  His heart overflowed into frenzied speech.

* “Give free course to your wrath,” Spendius urged. “Shout, blaspheme, ravage, slay. Grief is allayed with blood; since you can’t sate your love, gorge your hate.”

Matho resumed command, drilling his soldiers pitilessly. His courage and strength commanded respect; he inspired mystic dread, believed to converse with phantoms. Other captains followed his example.  The army became disciplined; Carthaginians heard bugle calls.  The Barbarians drew near.

To crush them, two armies were needed, one disembarking at Utica, the other at the Hot Springs. But only the sacred Legion, six thousand men at most, was available.  If the Barbarians moved east, they’d join nomads and disrupt desert commerce; west, Numidia would rise.  Lack of provisions would lead to devastation. The rich feared for their estates.

Hanno proposed atrocious measures: paying for Barbarian heads or burning their camp. Gisco wanted to pay them. The Ancients detested Gisco's popularity, fearing a master and monarchy.

Outside the fortifications lived a strange people, porcupine hunters, eating shellfish and serpents, catching hyenas for amusement. Their mud and wrack huts clung to the cliff. They lived without government or gods, feeble yet fierce, execrated for their diet. One morning, they vanished.

The Great Council decided. They approached the camp without finery, waving greetings, saying justice would be done. Many saw a mercenary camp for the first time.  Instead of chaos, they found terrible silence and order. A grassy rampart surrounded the army; streets were sprinkled with water; tawny eyes gleamed in tent shadows; pikes and panoplies dazzled. They spoke softly, fearing to disturb anything.

The soldiers requested provisions, promising payment. Oxen, sheep, fowl, fruit, lupins, and smoked scombri were sent.  They scorned the offerings, offering a pigeon's worth for a ram, a pomegranate's worth for goats. The "Eaters of Uncleanness" arbitrated, declaring them cheated. They drew swords, threatening slaughter.

Commissaries recorded years of service.  The number of mercenaries was unknown; the Ancients were dismayed by the enormous sum. The silphium reserve must be sold, towns taxed. The mercenaries would grow impatient; Tunis was already sympathetic; the rich, urged by Hanno's rage and Gisco's reproaches, urged citizens to appease the Barbarians.

Traders, scribes, and families visited the camp.  Soldiers allowed entry through a narrow passage, where Spendius searched them, and Matho scanned the crowd, seeking someone from Salammbo's palace.

The camp was like a city, teeming with people.  Two crowds mingled: one in linen or wool, the other in iron.  Servants and vendors moved among women of all nations, jaded by love or beaten by age, dying on roadsides. Nomad wives wore tawny robes; Cyrenaican musicians sang; old Negresses gathered dung; Syracusan women wore golden plates; Lusitanians wore shell necklaces; Gauls wore wolf skins; children butted and bit passersby.

Carthaginians walked through, the poor melancholy, the rest dissembling anxiety. Soldiers struck them, urging gaiety, inviting them to games, crushing feet or fracturing jaws. Slingers terrified them, Psylli with vipers, horsemen with horses. Carthaginians bent their heads, trying to smile. Some, feigning bravery, wanted to join; they split wood, curried mules, were buckled in armor, and rolled through the streets, having their hair pulled out.

Many believed Carthaginians were rich, begging for rings, girdles, sandals, or robes.  When the Carthaginians protested, they demanded wives or lives.

Military accounts were read and approved.  They demanded tents, then fine armor, then compensation for lost horses. They demanded payment for corn at wartime prices, four hundred times the original cost.  This injustice was infuriating, but they submitted.

Delegates swore renewed friendship. They exchanged excuses and caresses.  Then, they demanded punishment for those who estranged them from the Republic—Hanno's head.

They walked along the walls, demanding Hanno's head. The Council might have yielded, but for a final demand: maidens from illustrious families for their chiefs.  This, from Spendius, enraged the people; they refused. The mercenaries threatened to take their pay by force within three days.

The mercenaries' bad faith wasn't complete. Hamilcar's extravagant promises, though vague, were solemn and repeated. They might have believed Carthage would be theirs, with treasures to divide.  The disillusion touched their pride and greed.  Dionysius, Pyrrhus, Agathocles, and Alexander's generals had shown such fortunes.  Hercules was their ideal.  They knew soldiers could become kings.  Carthage usually kept its promises; this time, avarice brought peril. Numidians, Libyans, and all of Africa threatened. Only the sea remained, but there were the Romans. Carthage felt death surrounding it.

Gisco's intervention was necessary.  The Barbarians saw harbor chains lowered; three flat-bottomed boats entered the lake. Gisco stood at the prow, behind a huge chest. Interpreters followed, unarmed, in such numbers they jostled. The boats advanced amid shouts.

Soldiers ran to Gisco. He erected a tribune and declared he wouldn't leave until they were paid.  Applause erupted. He censured wrongs done to the Republic and Barbarians, blaming mutineers.  He, Hanno's enemy, was sent to prove good intentions. He began paying, starting with Libyans, ignoring the lists.

They filed by nationality, showing years of service, marked with green paint. Scribes dipped into the chest; others marked lead sheets. A man walked heavily.

* “Come closer,” Gisco said, suspecting fraud. “How many years?”
* “Twelve,” the Libyan replied.

Gisco felt his chin; callosities, "carobs," marked veterans.

* “Thief!” Gisco exclaimed. “Your shoulders should show your service!”

He tore off the man's tunic, revealing a scabbed back. He was a laborer.  He was decapitated amid hoots.

That night, Spendius roused the Libyans:

* “When others are paid, they’ll leave. You’ll remain scattered, defenseless! The Republic will take revenge! Don’t trust them! Both Suffets are agreed; this one is deceiving you! Remember the Island of Bones, and Xanthippus, sent back to Sparta in a rotten galley!”

* “What should we do?”
* “Reflect!”

The next two days saw Magdala, Leptis, and Hecatompylos men paid. Spendius approached the Gauls:

* “They’re paying Libyans, then Greeks, Balearians, Asiatics! You’ll receive nothing! You’ll never see home! They’ll kill you to save food!”

Gauls approached Gisco. Autaritus, wounded at Hamilcar's palace, was repelled and swore revenge.

Demands multiplied.  The most persistent entered Gisco's tent, showing their wounds. Those paid demanded more; outlaws claimed they were forgotten.  Tents strained and fell; the crowd swayed. Gisco remained motionless, gazing at the sea.

Matho often spoke with Spendius, then faced Gisco.  They exchanged insults.  The distribution continued; Gisco found ways to overcome obstacles.

Greeks quibbled about currency; Gisco explained, and they left. Negroes demanded white shells; they accepted money. Balearians were promised women, delayed for six months.

Zarxas, now strong, leaped onto his friends' shoulders:

* “Did you save any for the corpses?”

He pointed to Khamon's gate, its brass plates shining.  Every time Gisco spoke, shouts erupted. He retreated to his tent.

At sunrise, his interpreters were dead, each with a rush noose around their necks.  The rebellion was unchecked. Zarxas's reminder of the slain Balearians fueled distrust. They believed the Republic was deceiving them.  Interpreters were unnecessary. Zarxas sang war songs; Autaritus brandished his sword; Spendius whispered and gave daggers.  Some paid themselves; others wanted the distribution to continue.  Anger turned to hatred of Gisco.

Those who spoke for Gisco were stoned or beheaded. The knapsack pile was red. They were terrible after eating and drinking wine, forbidden in Punic armies. They raised cups towards Carthage, mocking its discipline. They returned to the exchequer and killed.  The word "strike" was universally understood.

Gisco knew he was abandoned, but wouldn't dishonor his country.  Promising ships, he swore by Moloch, throwing his necklace into the crowd.  Africans demanded corn. Gisco read Syssitia accounts, then stopped, eyes wide. The Ancients had fraudulently reduced the accounts.

* “Speak! Louder! He’s lying! Don’t trust him!”

He hesitated, then continued. Soldiers accepted the accounts, but were furiously jealous of Carthage's abundance. They broke open the chest; it was nearly empty.  They believed it inexhaustible; Gisco must have hidden some. They searched knapsacks. Matho led them.

* “The money! The money!”
* “Let your general give it to you!” Gisco replied.

An arrow hung from his ear; blood trickled from his tiara. At Matho's gesture, they advanced. Gisco held out his arms; Spendius bound his wrists; he was knocked down and disappeared.

They sacked his tent, finding only necessities, three Tanith images, and a black moonstone wrapped in ape skin.  Many Carthaginians, war-party members, were dragged out and thrown into the filth pit, chained to stakes, fed with javelins.

Autaritus berated them; they didn't understand, so he threw pebbles at their faces.  A languor settled over the army.  Anger turned to anxiety. Matho felt vague melancholy; Salammbo seemed indirectly insulted.  He sat by the pit, recognizing their groans.

They blamed the paid Libyans.  National and personal hatreds revived; reprisals would be formidable.  They must anticipate Carthage's vengeance.  Conventions and harangues continued; Spendius shook his head at proposals.

He casually asked Matho about springs within the city.

* “None!” Matho replied.

The next day, Spendius drew him aside:

* “Master, if your heart is dauntless, I’ll bring you into Carthage.”
* “How?”
* “Swear to obey and follow me like a shadow!”

Matho swore by Tanith. Spendius continued:

* “Tomorrow, after sunset, wait at the aqueduct's foot, between the ninth and tenth arcades. Bring an iron pick, a crestless helmet, and leathern sandals.”

The aqueduct crossed the isthmus—a Roman improvement on a Carthaginian design. Five rows of arches reached the Acropolis, sinking beneath the city to feed Megara's cisterns.

Spendius met Matho. He used a harpoon to scale the wall.  The cramp fell; they walked along the cornice, the cord nearly breaking. They reached the platform. Spendius felt the stones.

* “Here! Let’s begin!”

They dislodged a flagstone.  Horsemen galloped towards them. Matho recognized Narr' Havas.

* “What matter?” Spendius said, leaping into the hole.

Matho couldn't move his elbows.

* “We’ll return,” Spendius said. “Go first.”

They entered the water channel, swimming, their faces torn by stones.  The current carried them; they were nearly dead.  All went black; the current increased. They fell.

Resurfacing, they gasped for air. Arcades opened amid large walls separating basins.  Pale light fell on the waves.  The slightest sound echoed. They swam through arches, traversing chambers.  They found pavement.  They felt for an outlet, slipping and falling.  Exhausted, their eyes closed.  Spendius struck a grating; it gave way. They were on a staircase. A bronze door closed above. They opened it.  Pure air surrounded them.

The city was silent. Outpost fires shone like stars. Spendius, knowing the city imperfectly, suggested heading left towards Hamilcar’s palace.

* “No,” Spendius said. “Take me to Tanith’s temple.”

Matho started to speak.

* “Remember!” Spendius said, pointing to Chabar.

Matho silently turned towards the Acropolis. They crept along nopal hedges.  Spendius, eyes flaming, searched the bushes, daggers hanging from his arms.


# Chapter 5: Tanith

They reached Megara's rampart, finding a breach. The ground sloped downwards.

* “Listen,” Spendius said. “Fear nothing! I’ll fulfill my promise…”

He paused, reflecting.

* “Remember sunrise on Salammbo’s terrace? We were strong, but you wouldn’t listen!”  Then, gravely: “Master, in Tanith’s sanctuary is a mysterious veil, fallen from heaven, covering the goddess.”
* “I know.”
* “It’s divine; part of her. Gods reside where their images are. Carthage’s power comes from possessing it.”  He leaned close: “I brought you to steal it!”

Matho recoiled.

* “Begone! Find someone else! I won’t help in this execrable crime!”
* “Tanith is your enemy! She persecutes you! You’re dying from her wrath! You’ll be revenged. She’ll obey you; you’ll be immortal and invincible.”

Matho bowed his head. Spendius continued:

* “We’ll succumb; the army will be annihilated. We have no escape, no help, no pardon! What divine punishment can you fear, possessing their power? Would you rather die in defeat, in misery, or amid the populace’s outrages and funeral pyres? Master, you’ll enter Carthage among pontiffs, who’ll kiss your sandals. If Tanith’s veil weighs on you, you’ll reinstate it. Follow me! Take it!”

Matho felt a terrible longing. He wanted the veil without the sacrilege.  He thought its virtue might be obtained without theft. He stopped at the boundary of his thought, where it terrified him.

* “Come!”

They walked rapidly, silently. The ground rose; dwellings were near.  They turned into dark streets.  Esparto-grass strips beat against walls. Camels ruminated. They passed beneath a leafy gallery; dogs barked. The space widened; they saw the Acropolis's western face.  A black mass stretched at its foot: Tanith's temple. They leaped over the low wall.

This barrier enclosed a plane-tree wood, protecting against plague. Tents sold pastes, perfumes, garments, cakes, and alabaster goddess images. They had nothing to fear; rites were suspended when Chabar didn't appear. Matho slowed, stopping at three ebony steps.

* “Forward!” Spendius urged.

Trees alternated; the blue-pebble path creaked. Roses formed a bower. They reached an oval hole with a grating. Matho, frightened by the silence, said:

* “They mix fresh and bitter water here.”
* “I’ve seen it in Syria, in Maphug,” Spendius replied.

They ascended six silver steps. A huge cedar stood in the center, laden with offerings. They saw the temple's front: two porticoes flanked a tower adorned with a crescent moon. Vases of burning aromatics stood at corners. Pomegranates and coloquintidas adorned capitals.  A silver filigree hedge curved before a brass staircase.  A stone cone stood at the entrance, between gold and emerald stelae. Matho kissed his hand.

The first room was lofty, its roof pierced with apertures showing stars. Rush baskets held hair offerings.  A woman's body emerged from a breast-covered sheath, smiling, hands crossed.

They were in a transverse corridor, with a small altar against an ivory door.  Only priests could open it.

* “It’s impossible,” Matho said. “You didn’t think of this! Let’s go back!”

Spendius examined the walls. He wanted the veil not for its virtue (he believed only in the Oracle), but to dismay the Carthaginians. They searched for an exit.

Aedicules stood beneath trees. Stone phalluses rose; stags roamed. They retraced their steps between galleries, with small cells, tabourines, and cymbals. Women slept on mats, greasy with unguents, covered in tattoos, necklaces, and paint. Lotus trees encircled a fountain with fish. A glass-branched vine with emerald grapes stood against the wall.

Matho felt suffocated.  The symbols of fecundation, perfumes, and radiations overwhelmed him. He thought of Salammbo, merging her with the goddess. His love bloomed. Spendius calculated the women's sale price and the necklaces' weight.

The temple was impenetrable. They returned to the first chamber.  Spendius searched; Matho knelt, begging Tanith to prevent the sacrilege.

Spendius noticed an aperture above the door.

* “Rise!”

He made Matho stand, placing his feet on his head, reaching the air-hole, and disappearing. Matho felt a knotted cord—the one from the cisterns—fall on his shoulders. He climbed to Spendius.

## Hanno

"I should have carried her off!" Matho told Spendius that evening. "Seized her, torn her from her home! No one would have dared touch me!"

Spendius ignored him, luxuriating beside a honey-colored water jar, dipping his head in for frequent, generous drinks.

Matho pressed on. "What now? How do we re-enter Carthage?"

"I don't know," Spendius replied.

This apathy enraged Matho. "It's your fault! You dragged me in, then abandoned me, you coward! Why obey you? Do you think you're my master? You whore, you slave, son of a slave!" He gritted his teeth, hand rising above Spendius.

The Greek remained silent.  An earthen lamp glowed near the tent pole, where the zaimph shimmered amidst hanging arms.  Matho suddenly donned his boots, mail, and helmet.

"Where are you going?" Spendius asked.

"Back! Leave me! I'll bring her back! And if they resist, I'll crush them like vipers! I'll kill her, Spendius! Yes, I'll kill her!"

But Spendius, listening intently, snatched the zaimph, tossing it into a corner, covering it with fleece.  Voices murmured, torches flickered, and Narr' Havas entered, followed by twenty men.

They wore white cloaks, long daggers, copper necklaces, wooden earrings, and hyena-skin boots. Leaning on their spears, they resembled resting shepherds. Narr' Havas was the most striking; his slender arms were bound with pearl-adorned straps. A golden circlet held an ostrich feather behind his shoulder. His teeth flashed in a constant smile; his eyes were sharp, his demeanor alert and airy.

He'd come to join the mercenaries; the Republic threatened his kingdom. He'd aid the Barbarians, perhaps serving them well.

*   He offered elephants, wine, oil, barley, dates, siege materials, twenty thousand foot soldiers, and ten thousand horses.
*   He addressed Matho, the zaimph's possessor, now the army's chief.
*   He reminded Matho of their old friendship.

Matho watched Spendius nod in agreement. Narr' Havas continued, invoking the gods, cursing Carthage, breaking a spear in his fury. His men howled; Matho, swept up in the passion, accepted the alliance.

A white bull and black sheep, symbols of day and night, were sacrificed.  Arms were dipped in their blood. Narr' Havas touched Matho's chest; Matho reciprocated. They stained their tent canvases.

They feasted; leftover meat, skin, bones, horns, and hooves were burned.

Matho's return with the veil had been met with cheers. Even non-Canaanites felt the arrival of a genius.  Seizing the zaimph wasn't considered; its mysterious acquisition justified its possession, at least to the African soldiers. Others, with less ingrained hatred, were undecided.  Ships would have meant immediate departure.

Spendius, Narr' Havas, and Matho sent men to Punic tribes.

Carthage exploited these nations, demanding exorbitant taxes.  Arrears or murmurs were punished with chains, axes, or crosses.  The Republic dictated crops, supplies, and forbade weapons. Rebellious villages were sold; governors were judged by their extorted wealth. Beyond Carthage's reach were allies and roaming Nomads, a potential threat.  This system ensured abundant crops, skilled horse breeding, and superb plantations.

Ninety-two years later, Cato the Elder, a master of agriculture and slaves, was amazed. His constant cry in Rome was one of jealous greed.

Recent exactions had increased, causing many Libyan towns to surrender to Regulus.  Punishment included a thousand talents, twenty thousand oxen, three hundred bags of gold dust, grain, and the crucifixion or lion-feeding of tribal chiefs.  Tunis particularly loathed Carthage, its age and resentment fueling its hatred.  It crouched at Carthage's walls like a venomous beast.  Transportation, massacres, and epidemics didn't weaken it. It had aided Agathocles' son, and the Eaters of Uncleanness found arms there.


Couriers hadn't left when provincial rejoicing erupted.  They strangled officials, unearthed old weapons, forged swords from ploughs, and children sharpened javelins. Women contributed jewelry.  Lances piled up like maize sheaves.  Cattle and money flowed in.

Matho quickly paid mercenaries, becoming commander-in-chief—the schalishim—thanks to Spendius's idea.  Reinforcements poured in: aborigines, slaves, armed Negroes, and desperate merchants.  From the Acropolis, the growing army was visible.

Legion guards stood sentry on the aqueduct, near boiling asphalt vats. Below, the crowd stirred, unsure, experiencing the Barbarian's usual hesitation before walls.

Utica and Hippo-Zarytus refused alliance.  As self-governing Phoenician colonies, they had treaty clauses distinguishing them from the Republic.  They respected Carthage's protection, doubting the Barbarians' ability to conquer them.  They preferred neutrality and peace.

Their position was crucial. Utica, near the gulf, facilitated external aid for Carthage.  Taking Utica would leave Hippo-Zarytus, six hours away, to replace it, making Carthage impregnable.

Spendius urged immediate siege. Narr' Havas disagreed, advocating a border advance.  This was Matho and the veterans' view. Spendius would attack Utica, Matho Hippo-Zarytus, while the main force, under Autaritus, would secure Tunis and the plain. Narr' Havas would return for elephants and cavalry.

Women protested, craving Punic jewels. Libyans also objected; summoned against Carthage, they were now leaving.  Soldiers departed almost alone. Matho commanded his companions, Iberians, Lusitanians, and Western islanders.  Greek speakers followed Spendius for his cunning.

The army's sudden movement stunned onlookers. It stretched along the Ariana mountain road to Utica, near the sea.  A fragment remained before Tunis; the rest disappeared, reappearing on the gulf's other shore, vanishing into woods.

Perhaps eighty thousand strong, the Tyrian cities would offer no resistance. They'd return against Carthage, already under attack from the isthmus, soon to starve without provincial aid.  Carthage lacked political genius; its greed hindered the prudence born of higher ambitions.  A galley anchored on Libyan sands, it struggled to maintain its position. Nations roared around it; the slightest storm threatened this formidable machine.

The treasury was depleted by the Roman war and Barbarian dealings.  Soldiers were needed, but no government trusted the Republic. Ptolemaeus had recently refused two thousand talents.  The veil's theft disheartened them; Spendius had foreseen this.

Feeling hated, the nation clung to its money and gods; patriotism stemmed from its government's structure.

*   Power rested with all, preventing any single entity from dominating.
*   Private debts were public debts.
*   Canaanites monopolized commerce, accumulating wealth through piracy, usury, and exploitation.
*   This wealth opened magistracies.  Though power and money stayed within families, the oligarchy was tolerated due to the hope of eventual participation.

Merchant societies, where laws were crafted, chose exchequer inspectors, who nominated the Council of Ancients, accountable to the Grand Assembly of the wealthy.  Suffets, remnants of monarchy, were chosen from different families, deliberately pitted against each other to weaken each other. They couldn't decide on war; defeat meant crucifixion by the Great Council.

Carthage's power stemmed from the Syssitia, a large court in Malqua, where the first Phoenician ship supposedly landed.  It was a collection of small, archaic rooms, built of palm trunks and stone, housing various societies.  The wealthy gathered daily, discussing affairs from pepper procurement to Rome's extermination. Thrice monthly, they dined on the terrace, visible from below, without boots or cloaks, their diamond-covered fingers tracing dishes, earrings dangling amidst flagons—fat, half-naked, smiling, eating under the blue sky, like sharks in the sea.

Now, they couldn't hide their anxiety; they were too pale.  The waiting crowd escorted them home for news.  Houses were shut, streets filled and emptied; people flocked to the Acropolis or harbor. The Great Council deliberated nightly. Finally, the people assembled in Khamon Square, deciding to entrust Hanno, conqueror of Hecatompylos, with the situation.


He was a devout, crafty Carthaginian, pitiless towards Africans.  His wealth rivaled the Barcas'.  His administrative experience was unmatched.

He enrolled citizens, placed catapults on towers, demanded arms, ordered unnecessary galleys, and insisted on meticulous records.  His litter ascended the Acropolis staircases.  Sleepless nights were spent yelling war maneuvers.

Terror bred bravery.  The wealthy practiced with pikes at dawn, arguing in their inexperience, resting on tombs, then resuming.  Some overate for strength; others fasted to lose weight.

Utica repeatedly requested aid, but Hanno waited for final war machine adjustments.  He spent three more months equipping the rampart elephants—Regulus' conquerors, beloved by the people.  He had their breastplates recast, tusks gilded, towers enlarged, and purple caparisons made.  Calling their drivers "Indians," he ordered Indian attire: white pads, byssus drawers resembling shell valves.

Autaritus's army remained before Tunis, hidden behind a mud and thorn wall.  Negroes had planted sticks with frightening faces—masks of feathers, jackals', or serpents' heads—to terrify the enemy.  Believing themselves invincible, the Barbarians danced, wrestled, and juggled, confident of Carthage's imminent fall.  Anyone but Hanno would easily crush them, hampered by herds and women.  They lacked discipline; Autaritus had given up demanding it.

They stepped aside as he passed, rolling his big blue eyes.  By the lake, he'd remove his sealskin cloak, untie his long red hair, and soak it.  He regretted not deserting to the Romans with the two thousand Gauls from Eryx.

The sun often dimmed. The gulf and sea stilled like molten lead.  Brown dust whirled; palm trees bent; the sky vanished; stones bounced off animals.  The Gaul, lips pressed to his tent, gasped, exhausted and melancholic. He thought of autumn pastures, snowflakes, and the bellowing of urus in fog, imagining fires in straw-roofed cottages.

Others also longed for home, even if nearby. Carthaginian captives saw their homes across the gulf, on Byrsa's slopes.  Sentries patrolled; they were chained, each with an iron collar.  The crowd never tired of watching them; women showed children the tattered robes on their wasted limbs.

Autaritus's rage at Gisco's insult was immense; he'd have killed him but for his oath to Narr' Havas.  He'd drink barley and cumin until intoxicated, waking to horrible thirst.

Matho besieged Hippo-Zarytus, a lake-protected city with three circumvallations and fortified heights.  He'd never commanded such an operation.  Salammbo's image haunted him; he reveled in her beauty and vengeance.  He craved seeing her again, even considering a flag of truce. He'd often sound the assault, rushing the sea mole, snatching stones, striking, sword-fighting.  Barbarians surged; ladders broke; men tumbled into the water.  The tumult subsided; they'd start again.

He'd sit outside, wipe his blood-splattered face, gazing towards Carthage.

Before him stretched ponds meeting a lake; mountains rose behind; a black, pyramidal island stood in the lake.  To the left were sand dunes; the lapis-lazuli sea met the sky.  Verdure was broken by yellow; carobs shone like coral; vines drooped from sycamores; water murmured; larks hopped; the sun gilded tortoises emerging from reeds.

Matho sighed, lying face down, weeping, feeling wretched, insignificant, abandoned.  He'd never possess her; he couldn't even take a town.

Alone in his tent, he'd gaze at the zaimph.  What use was this divine object?  Doubt crept in.  Then, he'd imagine it connected to Salammbo, a part of her soul, and he'd breathe it, kiss it, sobbing.  He'd cover himself, pretending she was near.

He'd sometimes sneak away, stride over sleeping soldiers, mount a horse, and be in Spendius's tent two hours later.  He'd speak of the siege, but mainly of Salammbo.  Spendius urged prudence.

"Dismiss these distractions! You obeyed; now you command.  If Carthage isn't conquered, we'll get provinces. We'll be kings!"

But why didn't the zaimph bring victory?  Spendius said to wait.

Matho believed it affected Canaanites only: "It'll do nothing for me, but since they lost it, it'll do nothing for them."

A scruple arose; he feared offending Moloch by worshipping Aptouknos, asking Spendius which god deserved a human sacrifice.

"Keep sacrificing!" Spendius laughed.

Matho, sensing a hidden genius in Spendius's indifference, suspected him.

These armies contained all faiths and races; other gods inspired fear.  Many mixed practices.  Star worship was irrelevant; fatal or helpful constellations received sacrifices.  Chance amulets became divinities, as did names.  Many, after temple looting and slaughter, believed only in fate and death, sleeping peacefully like wild beasts. Spendius had spat on Jupiter Olympius, yet feared speaking aloud in the dark, always putting on his right boot first.

He built a terrace before Utica, but the rampart grew higher, negating his efforts.  He cared for his men, devising plans, recalling stratagems.  But Narr' Havas hadn't returned; anxiety reigned.


Hanno finally prepared.  One moonless night, he transported elephants and soldiers across the gulf on rafts, circling the Hot Springs mountain to avoid Autaritus.  Their slow march meant they reached the Barbarians at dawn on the third day, not morning as planned.

Utica had an eastern plain, a valley between mountains, and Barbarians blocking the harbor.  They slept (both sides were weary) when the Carthaginian army appeared.

*   Slingers were on the flanks.
*   The first line: Legion guards in golden scale armor, on maneless, hairless, earless horses with silver forehead horns, resembling rhinoceroses.
*   Between them: youths with small helmets, wielding ash javelins.
*   Heavy infantry followed.
*   Weapons piled high; some carried axes, lances, clubs, and swords; others bristled with darts.
*   Engines followed: carrobalistas, onagers, catapults, scorpions, on mule and ox carts.
*   Captains ran, giving orders, closing ranks.
*   Ancient commanders wore purple, their fringes tangled in boots.  Vermilion faces shone under helmets topped with gods; ivory-bordered shields with precious stones resembled suns over brass walls.

Carthaginians maneuvered clumsily; soldiers mocked them, urging them to eat, dust their gilded skin, and drink iron.

A green cloth appeared on Spendius's tent pole: the signal.  Carthaginian trumpets, cymbals, bone flutes, and drums answered.  Barbarians charged, facing enemies at javelin range.

A Balearic slinger hurled a clay bullet; an ivory shield shattered; armies clashed.  Greeks made horses rear; stone-throwers used oversized stones.  Punic soldiers exposed their right side; Barbarians broke lines, slaughtering, stumbling over the dead, blinded by blood.  Pikes, helmets, and swords swirled.  Carthaginian gaps widened; engines bogged; the Suffet's litter foundered; he was likely dead.  Barbarians were alone.

Dust settled; they began singing when Hanno appeared on an elephant, bareheaded, under a byssus parasol.  His necklace clashed against his tunic; diamond circles bound his arms; he brandished a huge lotus-shaped pike, flashing like a mirror.  The earth shook; Carthaginian elephants advanced, gilded tusks and blue ears, bronze-clad, shaking towers above scarlet caparisons, each holding three archers.

Soldiers were unprepared, frozen, hesitant.  Javelins, arrows, phalaricas, and lead rained from towers.  Some clung to caparisons, but hands were cut off; they fell.  Pikes broke; elephants trampled, tearing stakes, overturning tents.  Barbarians fled, hiding in hills.

Hanno stood before Utica's gates, sounding a trumpet.  Three judges appeared.  Utica wouldn't receive such well-armed guests; Hanno raged.  They finally agreed to limited entry.

Streets were too narrow for elephants; they remained outside.  The Suffet went to the baths, summoned cooks.

Three hours later, he bathed in cinnamomum oil, eating flamingo tongues with poppy seeds.  His Greek physician watched; boys rubbed his legs.  He dictated a letter to the Great Council, pondering punishments for prisoners.

"Stop!" he told a scribe.  "Bring some! I want to see them!"

Three Barbarians—Samnite, Spartan, Cappadocian—were brought forth.

"Proceed!" Hanno commanded.

"Rejoice, Baals' light! Your Suffet exterminated the hounds! Bless the Republic! Order prayers!"  He saw the captives, laughing.  "Ah! Sicca fellows!  Quiet today! It's me!  Recognize me?  Where are your swords?  Terrible fellows!" He pretended fear.  "You wanted horses, women, estates, offices, priesthoods!  I'll give you estates you'll never leave!  You'll marry new gibbets!  Your pay?  Melted lead!  Exalted positions among the clouds, near eagles!"

The ragged Barbarians stared, uncomprehending.  Wounded in the knees, they'd been captured with ropes.  Hanno was angered by their impassivity.

"Kneel, jackals, dust, vermin, excrement!  Silent!  Flay them alive!  No, later!"

He panted, oil overflowing, making his skin pink.

"Four days of sun.  Lost mules crossing Macaras.  Extraordinary courage—Ah! Demonades!  Reheat the bricks, red-hot!"

Rakes and furnaces clattered.  Incense smoked; naked, sweating shampooers applied a paste to his joints.  He thirsted, but the physician offered viper broth.

"Drink!  Serpent strength in your bones!  Courage, gods' reflection!  A priest of Eschmoun watches the stars causing your illness.  They're paling, you won't die."

"Oh, yes?  I won't die!"  His lips exhaled a corpse-like odor.  Coals burned in his eyeless sockets; wrinkled skin hung; ears protruded; deep lines gave him a wild beast's look.  His voice roared.

"Perhaps you're right, Demonades.  Ulcers closed.  I feel strong.  See how I eat!"

He devoured forcemeats, fish, gourds, oysters, horse-radish, truffles, and brochettes, imagining the prisoners' torture.  He remembered Sicca, venting rage on them.

"Traitors! Wretches! Infamous, accursed!  You outraged me—me, the Suffet!  Their services, the price of their blood!  Ah, yes, their blood!"  To himself: "All perish!  Not one sold!  Bring them to Carthage!  I'll be seen—but not enough chains?  Write: Send me—How many?  Ask Muthumbal!  Go! No pity!  Cut off their hands, bring them in baskets!"

Shrill cries pierced the hall, intensifying, then elephant trumpets erupted.  Tumult surrounded the town.

Carthaginians hadn't pursued; they feasted in pearl-bordered tents, while the mercenary camp was ruins.  Spendius regained courage, sending Zarxas to Matho, rallying men (losses were minor), enraged at their effortless defeat.  They found an abandoned petroleum vat.  Spendius smeared pigs with bitumen, set them alight, and drove them towards Utica.

Elephants panicked, fleeing uphill, pelted with javelins.  They turned, ripping, crushing Carthaginians.  Barbarians descended; the camp was sacked; Carthaginians were crushed against the gates.

Dawn revealed Matho's foot soldiers; Narr' Havas and his Numidians arrived, chasing fugitives.  This reversed the Suffet's situation.  He called for bath assistance.

The three captives remained.  A Negro leaned in.

"Well?"  Hanno replied slowly.  "Ah! Kill them!"

The Ethiopian drew a dagger; three heads fell.  One bounced into the feast, floating in the basin.  Morning light entered; bodies bubbled like fountains; blood flowed over mosaics.  Hanno rubbed his knees with the blood; it was a cure.

Evening found him escaping to rejoin his army.  He found its remnants.

Four days later, at Gorza, Spendius's troops appeared.  Twenty lances could have stopped them, but Carthaginians watched, stunned.  Hanno recognized Narr' Havas, who bowed, making an incomprehensible sign.

The return was terrifying; they marched at night, hiding by day.  Deaths occurred; they often felt lost.  They reached Cape Hermaeum, where ships awaited.

Hanno, exhausted, desperate, especially over elephant losses, asked Demonades for poison.  He felt the cross awaiting him.

Carthage lacked the strength to be indignant.  Losses totaled: 100,972 shekels of silver, 15,623 of gold, eighteen elephants, fourteen council members, three hundred wealthy, eight thousand citizens, three months' worth of grain, baggage, and war engines!  Narr' Havas's defection was certain; both sieges resumed.  Autaritus's army stretched from Tunis to Rhades.  Smoke rose from burning mansions.

One man could have saved the Republic.  People regretted slighting him; even the peace party offered holocausts for Hamilcar's return.

The zaimph had disturbed Salammbo.  She heard the goddess's footsteps, waking screaming.  She daily sent food to temples; Taanach was exhausted; Schahabarim never left her.

# 7 Chapter
## Hamilcar Barca

The Moon Announcer, watching from Eschmoun's temple, spotted a bird-like shape skimming the sea.

It was a trireme, with three tiers of oars, a carved horse on the prow.  The rising sun prompted the Announcer to sound a brazen cry.

People emerged, disbelieving, arguing.  The mole filled.  They recognized Hamilcar's trireme.

It advanced proudly, cleaving foam, sail full, oars beating time.  The ploughshare keel and rearing horse seemed to speed across the sea.

Rounding the promontory, the wind died; a man stood beside the pilot: Hamilcar, the Suffet!  Steel gleamed around him; a red cloak showed his arms; long pearls hung from his ears; his beard rested on his chest.

The galley approached the mole; the crowd shouted greetings, blessings, and warnings.

He didn't reply, seemingly deafened by oceans and battles.  Below the Acropolis staircase, he looked at Eschmoun's temple, then the sky, shouting orders.  The trireme grazed the storm-staying idol, entering the merchant harbor, pushing aside other ships.  People rushed, some swimming towards it.  It reached the gate, which rose, swallowing the trireme.

The Military Harbor was separate; ambassadors passed between walls to Khamon's temple.  The round harbor was ringed by quays and sheds.  Two pillars with Ammon's horns stood before each shed.  The marine Suffet's house was on a central island.

The water was clear; Hamilcar recognized his former triremes, perhaps twenty remaining, leaning or upright, gilded, bearing mystic symbols.  Chimaeras lacked wings; gods lacked arms; bulls lacked horns.  Half-painted, motionless, rotting, yet evocative, smelling of voyages, they seemed to say, "It's us! And YOU are vanquished!"

Only the marine Suffet could enter the admiral's house; until proven dead, he was considered alive.  The Ancients avoided a master; this applied to Hamilcar.

The Suffet entered deserted rooms, recognizing familiar yet astonishing objects.  The vestibule's perfuming pan held Melkarth conjuration ashes.  This wasn't his hoped-for return.  Assaults, fires, legions, storms, Drepanum, Syracuse, Lilybaeum, Etna, Eryx—five years of battles—until Sicily's loss.  He saw citron groves, shepherds, and his heart leaped at the thought of a new Carthage.  Projects and memories swirled; he felt anguish, weakness, and a need for the gods.

He ascended to the highest level, opening a small oval chamber with a golden shell staple.

Delicate black discs, transparent as glass, lit the room.  Between them were holes containing heavy dark stones—abaddirs fallen from the moon.  They represented stars, sky, fire, night, and earth's cohesion.  A heavy atmosphere filled the mystic space; stones were whitened with wind-blown sand.

Hamilcar counted them, veiled his face, knelt, and stretched out.

Daylight struck black lattice shutters.  Arborescences, hillocks, and animals appeared, light entering peacefully yet terrifyingly, like behind the sun.  He banished forms, symbols, and names to grasp the immutable spirit.  Planetary vitality penetrated him; he felt a scorn for death and accidents.  Rising, fearless, he ascended the tower overlooking Carthage.

The city curved downwards: cupolas, temples, golden roofs, houses, palm trees, and glass balls.  Ramparts bordered this horn of plenty.  Harbors, squares, courts, streets, and tiny people were visible.  If Hanno hadn't arrived late at Aegatian islands!  He gazed at the horizon, stretching towards Rome.

The Acropolis steps were crowded; Khamon Square pressed forward; terraces filled.  A few recognized him; he withdrew, increasing anticipation.

Below, he found important party members: Istatten, Subeldia, Hictamon, Yeoubas.  They recounted events since peace: Ancients' greed, soldiers' departure and return, demands, Gisco's capture, the zaimph's theft, Utica's relief and abandonment.  No one mentioned Hamilcar's situation.  They separated, to meet at Moloch's temple.

A tumult erupted; someone forced entry.  Hamilcar ordered the stranger's admittance.

An old, wrinkled Negress entered, wrapped in veils.  They stared; Hamilcar started; slaves withdrew.  He guided her to a remote room.

She kissed his feet; he raised her.

"Where have you left him, Iddibal?"

"There, Master."  She removed veils, revealing a strong old man, tanned by sand, wind, and sea.  White hair crested his skull; he gestured to his discarded disguise.

"You did well, Iddibal!  No one suspects?"

He swore by the Kabiri to secrecy.  They lived three days' journey from Hadrumetum, on a turtle-filled shore.  "As you commanded, Master, I teach him javelin and driving."

"He's strong?"

"Yes, Master, and intrepid!  No fear of serpents, thunder, or phantoms.  He runs barefoot on precipices."

"Speak!"

"He makes snares.  Last moon, he caught an eagle; blood sprayed like roses.  The eagle attacked; he held it, laughing proudly."

Hamilcar was impressed.

"But he's restless.  He gazes at ships; he's melancholic, rejects food, inquires about gods, wants to know Carthage."

"No, no! Not yet!"

The slave understood the danger.

"How to restrain him?  I make promises; I came to buy him a silver-handled dagger with pearls."

He explained how he'd posed as Salammbo's woman to reach Hamilcar.

Hamilcar deliberated.  "Tomorrow, sunset, behind Megara's purple factories, imitate a jackal's cry thrice.  If you don't see me, return on the first of each moon.  Forget nothing!  Love him!  You may speak of Hamilcar."

The slave resumed his disguise; they left.  Hamilcar walked alone; Ancients' meetings were secret.

# Chapter 8: The Battle of the Macaras

The next day, Hamilcar secured two hundred and twenty-three thousand kikars of gold from the Syssitia. He then levied a fourteen-shekel tax on the wealthy, even including women and children.  He even compelled the priestly colleges to contribute—a shocking act by Carthaginian standards.

He demanded all horses, mules, and weapons. Those who hid their wealth had their possessions sold. To deter others, Hamilcar himself donated sixty suits of armor and fifteen hundred gomers of meal—a contribution equal to the Ivory Company's.

He sent to Liguria for three thousand mountaineers, experienced in bear-hunting, paying them six months' wages upfront at four minae a day.  An army was needed, but unlike Hanno, Hamilcar was selective. He rejected sedentary workers, the weak, and the timid. He welcomed the disreputable, the dregs of Malqua, sons of barbarians, and freedmen.  He promised some New Carthaginians full citizenship as a reward.

His first task was reforming the Legion. These arrogant young men, who considered themselves the Republic's military elite, governed themselves. Hamilcar demoted their officers, subjected them to harsh training—running, jumping, scaling Byrsa, throwing javelins, wrestling, and sleeping in the squares. Their families visited, pitying their plight.

He ordered shorter swords and stronger boots. He reduced baggage and the number of servants.  He seized three hundred Roman pila from the Temple of Moloch, despite the pontiff's objections.

He organized a formidable phalanx of seventy-two elephants—those returned from Utica and privately owned—arming their drivers with mallets and chisels to kill them if they fled.

He bypassed the Grand Council in appointing generals. The Ancients cited laws, but Hamilcar disregarded them.  His authority was absolute.

He assumed control of the war, government, and finances.  To prevent accusations, he appointed Suffet Hanno to audit his accounts.

He worked on the ramparts, demolishing old inner walls for building materials.  The resulting class divisions were stark: patricians resented the destruction, while plebeians rejoiced, though unsure why.

Troops paraded daily. Trumpets blared, chariots carried supplies, women tore linen.  Hamilcar's spirit infused the Republic.

He divided his soldiers into even numbers, alternating strong and weak men.  This ensured the weaker soldiers were supported.  His four thousand ninety-six hoplites, including three thousand Ligurians and Carthage's best, formed a phalanx. They wore bronze helmets and wielded fourteen-cubit-long ashen sarissae.

Two thousand slingers were supported by eight hundred men armed with round shields and Roman swords.  Nineteen hundred Legion guardsmen formed the heavy cavalry, clad in vermilion bronze like Assyrian Clinabarians. Four hundred Tarentine mounted archers, with weasel-skin caps, double-edged axes, and leather tunics, completed the cavalry. Twelve hundred Negroes from the caravan quarter ran alongside the stallions.

All was ready, yet Hamilcar delayed.  He often ventured alone to the Macaras river mouths at night. Was he planning to join the mercenaries? Ligurians camped near his house.

The rich's fears were confirmed when three hundred barbarians approached the walls.  Hamilcar opened the gates; they were deserters, drawn by fear or loyalty, returning to their master.

The mercenaries weren't surprised by Hamilcar's return; they believed him immortal.  He was fulfilling his promise—a reasonable hope, given the chasm between the country and army. They felt no guilt; the feast was forgotten.

Captured spies revealed the truth.  Bitter mercenaries raged; even the lukewarm grew furious.  The two sieges had exhausted them; a battle was preferable. Many deserted, but news of Hamilcar's army brought them back; Matho rejoiced.

"At last! At last!" he cried.

His resentment toward Salammbo shifted to Hamilcar.  His hatred found a focus, and the ease of revenge fueled his fantasies. He imagined himself parading Hamilcar's head, then embracing Salammbo. This unattainable desire tortured him.  He vowed to lead the war, knowing he might not return.  He resolved to make it merciless.

He found Spendius:

"Gather your men! I'll bring mine! Warn Autaritus! We're lost if Hamilcar attacks! Understand? Rise!"

Spendius was stunned by Matho's authority.  Matho usually followed others, but now he was calm yet terrifying.  A fierce resolve shone in his eyes.

The Greek, Spendius, ignored Matho's urgency. He lived in a Carthaginian tent, drinking, playing cottabos, and conducting the siege laxly. He'd contacted people in the city and believed it would surrender soon.

Narr' Havas, moving between the armies, agreed with Spendius, criticizing Matho's rashness.

"Go, if you're afraid!" Matho retorted. "You promised pitch, sulfur, elephants, soldiers, horses! Where are they?"

Narr' Havas reminded him of destroying Hanno's cohorts.  The elephants were being hunted, soldiers armed, horses en route.  Narr' Havas's irritating calm silenced Matho.

A breathless, bleeding stranger arrived, speaking an unintelligible dialect, his wide eyes hinting at battle. Matho summoned his horsemen.

They formed a circle. Narr' Havas, mounted, bit his lip, then split his men, sending one half to wait, leading the other toward the mountains.

"Master," Spendius murmured, "I don't like this—Hamilcar's return, Narr' Havas leaving…"

"What does it matter?" Matho scoffed.

This strengthened the need to attack before Hamilcar, uniting with Autaritus. But lifting the siege risked attacks from the townspeople while facing the Carthaginians.  After much debate, they decided...

# 9. Chapter: In the Field

Hamilcar anticipated the mercenaries at Utica, or a counterattack.  His forces were insufficient for sustained assault, so he moved south along the river's right bank, securing against surprise.  His plan:  first, to win over rebelling tribes, isolating the mercenaries. Then, he would annihilate them.

Within fourteen days, he pacified the region between Thouccaber and Utica, including Tignicabah, Tessourah, Vacca, and western towns.  Zounghar, Assoura, Djeraado, Thapitis, and Hagour sent embassies. Locals offered food, begged protection, and denounced the mercenaries. Some even presented mercenary heads—taken from corpses, as many had perished in the flight.


The day after his victory, Hamilcar sent two thousand captives to Carthage. They arrived in chains, the wounded bleeding, driven by horsemen.  Carthage erupted in joy.  Six thousand mercenaries were reported dead; the war was over.  Celebrations ensued:  the Pataec Gods were honored, doors opened, timbrels sounded, temples illuminated.  The goddess's servants even prostituted themselves.  Rewards were bestowed: land for conquerors, holocausts for Melkarth, gold for Hamilcar.


Hamilcar petitioned the Ancients to exchange all captured mercenaries for Gisco and other imprisoned Carthaginians.  Autaritus's Libyan and Nomad army largely ignored these Italiote and Greek mercenaries.  The Republic's offer seemed suspicious; Autaritus refused. The Ancients, ignoring Hamilcar's pleas, ordered the captives' execution. Hamilcar hoped to integrate the best into his army, fostering defections.  But hatred prevailed.

Two thousand mercenaries were crucified near the Mappalian tombs.  Carthaginians of all classes—traders, cooks, embroiderers, even widows and children—participated in their agonizing deaths.  The spectacle lasted days and nights.  The event even engaged the usually apathetic Malquan people. The Ancients cleverly unified the populace through this shared act of vengeance.

Crows gathered, forming a massive, swirling cloud visible for miles.  The stench forced the Carthaginians to remove the bodies; some were burned, others cast into the sea, washing ashore near Autaritus's camp.  Terrified, Autaritus's army retreated, intending to block Hamilcar's access to Tyrian towns and Carthage.  Meanwhile, Spendius, Matho, and Autaritus would pursue him from the east, west, and south, respectively. Unexpectedly, Narr' Havas arrived with camels, elephants, and six thousand horsemen.  Hamilcar had secretly dealt with Masgaba, a Gaetulian brigand, to distract Narr' Havas in his own kingdom.  Narr' Havas, however, thwarted Masgaba's plans and joined the mercenaries.

The four mercenary leaders planned a prolonged war.  They sought Roman assistance, a mission Spendius, as a fugitive, couldn't undertake.  Twelve men from Greek colonies embarked on a Numidian sloop.  Strict discipline was enforced: daily inspections, no leaning on shields, minimal baggage, Roman-style load-carrying.  Matho created cataphract cavalry for elephant defense.  Pillaging and mistreatment of non-Punics were forbidden.  Food rationing led to conflict; Matho expelled the women, who fled to Autaritus's camp.  The remaining women sought refuge in Carthage, where some were claimed by the Syssitia or married New Carthaginians.  Others followed the armies, hindering the mercenaries. Matho brutally repelled them.

Matho, consumed by Moloch's influence, committed atrocities.  He rendered fields barren when unable to pillage them.  He urged Autaritus and Spendius to hasten, but Hamilcar's movements were unpredictable.  He eluded pursuit, seemingly leading the mercenaries.  This exhausting game depleted Hamilcar's forces and local support.  Carthage offered no aid, perhaps believing his victory sufficient.  Hanno's faction downplayed Hamilcar's success to undermine him.

Despairing of Carthage, Hamilcar forcibly requisitioned supplies and men from the tribes, causing them to flee.  His army was surrounded by desolation.  The Carthaginians, enraged, began to sack the provinces, setting fires that spread across the mountains.  They encountered desperate mercenaries hiding in the landscape.

Utica and Hippo-Zarytus, freed from siege, refused Hamilcar's requests for aid.  He moved north, aiming to seize a Tyrian coastal town for supplies and manpower.  He coveted Utica's harbor.

Hamilcar approached Hippo-Zarytus cautiously but was forced into a column to climb the mountain separating the valleys.  At sunset, they encountered Spendius's army, using Roman ensigns.  Matho's Iberians, Lusitanians, Balearians, Gaetulians, and Narr' Havas's Numidians were also present, along with Autaritus's rabble.  The mercenaries, surprised by their own success, paused.

Hamilcar formed a defensive circle.  The mercenaries, exhausted, decided to wait.  Their fires illuminated their camp, leaving Hamilcar's in shadow.  Hamilcar dug Roman-style trenches and built a parapet.  The mercenaries were stunned by the fortified Carthaginian position.

They saw Hamilcar giving orders, a sight that stirred some with emotion.  A simultaneous attack would be disastrous.  Matho, however, led a reckless assault, only to be repulsed by stones from captured catapults.  This failure shattered mercenary morale.  Spendius advocated a siege, but the Carthaginians found water.  They defended their position with projectiles.  The siege would eventually favor the mercenaries, so Hamilcar initiated negotiations for time.

A message was sent, justifying Hamilcar's actions and offering Utica or Hippo-Zarytus as plunder.  This caused division and mistrust among the mercenaries.  The Gauls joined forces with Cisalpine Gauls.

The four leaders met nightly, using Pyrrhus's wargame figures.  Spendius urged action; Matho raged, Autaritus agreed, and Narr' Havas despaired.

Hamilcar strengthened his defenses, digging another trench and building towers.  Food rationing led to harsh measures.  The mercenaries, well-supplied by the tribes, remained unaware of the Carthaginians' desperation.

Libyans used captured rich mercenaries as shields, a sight that horrified the Carthaginians, who recognized Gisco.  Hamilcar launched a desperate attack, only to be driven back.  A Carthaginian guard was killed and his blood drunk by Zarxas, a horrifying act that shocked the mercenaries.

The Carthaginians ceased attacks, expecting death.  Provisions dwindled; even dogs were eaten.  Internal conflicts arose.  The Carthaginians endured constant attacks, building protective galleries.

The sun's daily movement cast the gorge into shadow.  Hamilcar's anger towards Carthage grew, as did the murmurs of his troops.  Carthage offered no help.

Carthage raged at the defeat, but lacked resources for new mercenaries.  Hamilcar's actions were criticized:  he should have annihilated the mercenaries, not ravaged the tribes.  The populace blamed him, even the Ligurians.  The priests attributed the disaster to Hamilcar's impiety.

The Eloul heat intensified, adding to the misery.  Carthage was consumed by fear and mourning.  Rumors of mercenary advances caused panic.  Their impotence fueled their anger.

Evening brought despair as they watched the sun set towards the mercenary camps.  They awaited the holy festival, turning towards Moloch and abandoning Tanith, blaming the loss of the zaimph and Salammbo's actions.  A vague plan to sacrifice Salammbo arose.

# 10. Chapter: The Serpent

Salammbo's anxieties centered on her serpent, a black python, a national and personal fetish.  The serpent was weakening, refusing food. Its skin was yellowed and wrinkled.  Salammbo's despair mirrored the serpent's decline; she felt a similar constriction in her heart.

She experienced a strange mixture of pride and horror at having seen the zaimph.  She longed for escape, for a pilgrimage to Aphaka.  Isolation and uncertainty about her father's fate consumed her.

She wandered her silent apartment, engaging in small rituals.  Doves brought a brief respite, but her despair returned.  She often refused food, experiencing troubled dreams.  Schahabarim's presence was a comfort, yet she resented his power over her.

Schahabarim, a learned priest, attempted to cure her, using herbs, mandrakes, and rituals.  His own beliefs were evolving, questioning established cosmology.  He secretly blamed Rabbet for his own misfortune.  His days were spent in temple duties.

Salammbo was like a flower in a tomb.  Schahabarim, despite his feelings for her, was harsh.  He felt more alone because of her beauty and purity.  He revealed his evolving beliefs during their night-time stargazing.

He described the cyclical journey of souls, from earth to sun.  Salammbo accepted his words as truth.  He emphasized Baal's dominance, the male principle of destruction.  He never mentioned Rabbet, which Salammbo attributed to shame.

Schahabarim, despite his doubts about Tanith, sought a divine sign.  He devised a plan to save Carthage and his faith: Salammbo must retrieve the zaimph.

Salammbo was terrified, feeling she would die.  Schahabarim believed her death a small price for Carthage's salvation.  He left for three days, returning to intensify her resolve.

He recounted the criticism of Hamilcar, emphasizing her guilt and Rabbet's demand for sacrifice.  They witnessed the chaotic preparations for a desperate Carthaginian attack.

Salammbo hesitated, fearing Matho and Moloch.  She consulted her serpent, finding its basket empty.  She then found it shedding its skin, a sign of renewal.

Salammbo's resolve grew.  She asked Schahabarim how to retrieve the zaimph.  He revealed the plan: she must be alone with Matho in his tent.  She would be submissive to his desires.  He refused to accompany her.


## Rewritten pages 121–144

# Chapter 11: In the Tent

Salammbo knelt as Schahabarim, left hand raised, right hand extended, swore to return Tanith's mantle to Carthage.  She repeated his imprecations, faltering with each word. He detailed her purifications and fastings, and how she should reach Matho. A guide familiar with the routes would accompany her.

Feeling liberated, she focused only on seeing Matho again, now blessing Schahabarim's guidance.

Carthage's doves were migrating to Sicily's Mount Eryx and Venus' temple.  For days before their departure, they called to each other, gathering for a final flight. One evening, they soared, a great white cloud against the blood-red sky.  They seemed to descend into the waves, then vanished, swallowed by the sun.  Watching them, Salammbo bowed her head. Taanach, sensing her sorrow, comforted her.

"But they will return, Mistress."

"Yes, I know."

"And you will see them again."

"Perhaps," she sighed.

To maintain secrecy, Salammbo sent Taanach to Kinisdo for supplies—vermilion, aromatics, a linen girdle, and new garments—instead of requesting them from the stewards.  Taanach was amazed but didn't question her.  Schahabarim's appointed day arrived.

Around noon, she saw a blind old man, a child walking before him, a blackwood cithara at his hip, amongst the sycamore trees. Eunuchs, slaves, and women were dismissed; the mystery must remain secret.

Taanach lit four tripods with strobus and cadamomum, then hung Babylonian tapestries, shielding Salammbo from even the walls.  A kinnor player crouched behind the door; a boy played a reed flute.  The city's roar faded; violet shadows lengthened. Across the gulf, olive groves and yellow lands blurred into a bluish haze.  A profound stillness settled.

Salammbo crouched by the basin, raised her sleeves, and began her methodical ablutions. Taanach brought a coagulated liquid in an alabaster phial—the blood of a black dog, slaughtered by barren women on a winter's night near a sepulchre. Salammbo rubbed it on her ears, heels, and right thumb.  Her nail remained stained red.

The moon rose; the cithara and flute played. Salammbo removed her jewelry and simar, untied her hair, letting it cool her shoulders. The music—three frantic, repeated notes—continued. Taanach kept time; Salammbo chanted prayers, her garments falling around her.

The tapestry trembled; a python's head appeared. It descended, coiled, then rose erect, its eyes glittering.  A chill, perhaps shame, made her hesitate. Remembering Schahabarim's orders, she approached. The python draped itself around her, its head and tail trailing. Salammbo brought its mouth to her teeth, then reclined beneath the moon's light.  The python's black, gold-scaled rings tightened.

She panted, felt herself dying, the serpent gently beating her thigh with its tail. The music ceased; the serpent slithered away.

Taanach returned, lighting candelabra, applying Lawsonia to her hands, vermilion to her cheeks, antimony to her eyelids, and shaping her eyebrows. Salammbo, seated, grew pale from the aromatics and fasts.

"Go on!" Salammbo insisted, reviving. Impatience seized her; she urged Taanach.

"Mistress, you have no one waiting!" Taanach grumbled.

"Yes," Salammbo whispered, "someone waits for me."

Surprised, Taanach asked, "What orders, Mistress? If you're to be away—"

Salammbo sobbed.  "You're suffering! Don't go! Take me!" Taanach cried, striking her withered breast. "You no longer love me!"

"No, I love you! Be comforted!" Salammbo said.

Taanach, with a grimace, resumed.  Following Schahabarim's instructions, she adorned Salammbo with barbaric refinement and ingenuity.  Over a delicate tunic, she added a feathered one, a golden girdle, blue trousers, and a long, green-streaked Seres robe.  A purple square, weighted with sandastrum, adorned her shoulder, topped by a black mantle.

"You'll not be more beautiful on your wedding day!" Taanach declared.

"My wedding," Salammbo mused.

Taanach presented a large copper mirror. Salammbo adjusted a lock of gold-dusted hair, adorned with pearls. The candelabra light enhanced her beauty, the gems around her waist, arms, hands, and toes dazzling. She smiled.

She paced, restless. A cock crowed. She quickly donned a yellow veil, a scarf, and blue boots.

"See if a man with two horses waits beneath the myrtles," she told Taanach.

Taanach barely returned before Salammbo descended the galley stairs.

"Mistress!" cried the nurse.

Salammbo silenced her with a finger to her lips.  From afar, Taanach saw a gigantic shadow in the cypress avenue—an omen of death.  She returned, tearing her face, pulling her hair, then sobbing silently.


# Chapter 12: The Aqueduct

Salammbo's guide led her past the pharos, down Molouya's steep lanes. Dawn approached.  They passed through the Teveste gate, following the ramparts, then the Taenia, a narrow strip between the gulf and lake.

Carthage was deserted.  Salammbo shivered despite her veils.  The sun warmed her; she dozed.  After the Hot Springs, they quickened their pace.

Fields were empty, save for scattered corn and barley.  Black villages dotted the horizon.  Ruined walls and collapsing cottages hinted at past lives.  Ragged figures occasionally emerged, then vanished.  Salammbo and her guide pressed on.

Deserted plains stretched, charcoal dust trailing behind them.  Peaceful brooks offered respite.  Near rose-bays, her horse shied at a corpse.  The guide, a Temple servant often used by Schahabarim, settled her. He walked beside them, whipping the horses, offering Salammbo food from his scrip.

Three Barbarians, then more, crossed their path.  Their sticks bristled with brass; cutlasses gleamed.  The guide responded to their greetings and jests, claiming Salammbo was a sick youth seeking a cure.

Evening approached.  They reached a stone enclosure, a rambling building. A dog patrolled the wall.  The guide threw pebbles; they entered a vaulted hall.

An old woman huddled by a fire, muttering vengeance.  The guide sought food; she offered only a tale of past suffering.  He showed her gold; she relented, retrieving wine and fish.

Salammbo refused the food, sleeping on the horses' caparisons.  The guide awoke her before dawn, killing the howling dog and reviving the horses with its blood.  The old woman cursed them. Salammbo touched her amulet.

They continued. Salammbo inquired about their arrival.  The road undulated; grasshoppers chirped.  Vipers and eagles passed; the guide ran.  Salammbo remained veiled, fearing to soil her garments.

Carthaginian watchtowers offered shade.  They detoured, avoiding encounters.  Desolation returned: mosaic fragments, leafless olive trees, a burnt town with human and animal skeletons.

Night fell.  They saw flames—the Clinabarians' camp.  The guide led them past the Barbarian camp, through a breach.  A sentry spotted Salammbo; an arrow grazed her cloak.

"To speak to Matho," she said. "I'm a fugitive."

He whistled; Matho arrived as the moon rose.  Salammbo's veils and draperies concealed her.

"Lead me to your tent," she commanded.

A memory stirred Matho.  His heart pounded.

"Follow me," he said.

The camp was chaotic. Fires burned; horses were tethered; tents and huts were scattered. Soldiers rested or slept. Salammbo's horse leaped over them.

Matho led her to his tent.  A pit to the right held groaning captives.  Two Negroes held resin lights.  Matho entered; Salammbo followed.  The tent was lit by a lotus-shaped lamp. Weapons, whips, cymbals, and necklaces lay scattered.  The wind carried dust and the scent of elephants.

"Who are you?" Matho asked.

Salammbo's gaze fell on the zaimph.  She tore off her veils.

"To take it!" she cried, pointing.

Matho stared, captivated by her beauty.  He lightly touched her chest; the contact shook him.  He drew her close, sitting beside the lion-skin bed.

"How beautiful you are!" he repeated.

Her discomfort grew; she remembered Schahabarim.  Matho held her hands, inhaling her scent.  How had she come here?  Not for the zaimph.

To soften him, Salammbo spoke of his past cruelty, his devastation of Carthage, her hatred.

Matho leaped up, his pride swelling.  Salammbo continued, recounting his terrifying nocturnal visit.

"No! To give it to you!" Matho cried. "It belonged to you!"

"I, Tanith?" Salammbo murmured.

Thunder rumbled.

Matho spoke of his past meekness, his desire for her, his destruction of Carthage to reach her.  He described his thoughts of her amidst battle.

Salammbo, amazed by his strength, felt the goddess's or Moloch's power.  She reached for the zaimph.

"Going back to Carthage?" Matho roared.  "You belong to me!"

He sobbed, begging her forgiveness, his love overwhelming him.  Salammbo, weakened, yielded.  She swooned onto the bed; the zaimph fell over her.

Matho kissed her. He spoke of a golden island, crystal grottoes, a life beyond war. He served her, humbled himself.

Salammbo found her chainlet broken.  Memories of Carthage flooded her, but an abyss separated her from that past.

The storm passed.  Matho slept.  Salammbo saw a dagger; a bloody desire surged.  Matho stirred; the dagger fell.

Shouts erupted; the Libyan camp was ablaze.  Matho rushed out; Salammbo was alone.  She examined the zaimph, feeling no anticipated joy.

Gisco, the aged captive, crawled into the tent.  The Mercenaries had broken the Ancients' legs.  Gisco had overheard their conversation.

"It is you!" Salammbo gasped.

"Why have the Baals not granted me mercy?" Gisco cried. "To spare me cursing you!"

Salammbo recoiled from his uncleanness.  Gisco recounted Carthage's ruin, Salammbo's shame, Hamilcar's proximity.

Salammbo, seeing Hamilcar, fled.  She found Schahabarim's man, escaped the camp, and fled.

Matho awoke; the zaimph was gone.  The camp was under attack.  He rushed out.

Narr' Havas, betraying Matho, surrendered to Hamilcar.  Hamilcar, using Narr' Havas's army, crushed the Mercenaries.

Salammbo, returning with the zaimph, was hailed as a savior.  Hamilcar, noticing her broken chainlet, suspected treachery.  He gave Salammbo to Narr' Havas as a reward.

A lance was exchanged; their thumbs were tied; corn was poured upon them.


# Chapter 13: The Aqueduct (Continued)

The Mercenaries lay in heaps—wounded, dead, dying. Hamilcar had driven them into a broader space, crushing them.  The loss of the zaimph weakened them.

The camps were recognizable by their palisades.  Corpses, weapons, and debris littered the mountain.  The stench was overpowering.

Survivors huddled, silent and afraid.  The lake of Hippo-Zarytus shone in the distance.  The Barbarians sighed, longing for home.

Night fell; vermin left the corpses.  Crows watched.  Yellow dogs devoured the dead.

Fugitives returned.  Corpses were collected, identified by their tattoos.  Funeral pyres were built for the Latins; Greeks dug pits; others used various burial methods.  The lamentations were heart-wrenching.  Women tore at the corpses; men mutilated them.  Forty-three Samnites committed suicide.  Exhausted, they slept near their dead.

Carthaginian soldiers arrived, offering service to the survivors.  Many refused; others, cowed by fear, accepted.  The Barbarians, overwhelmed by grief and shame, attacked the Carthaginian prisoners in the pit.

Matho sat amidst the ruins of his tent, seeing nothing, hearing nothing.  He noticed a red mark—Narr' Havas's handprint.  He burned the remains of his tent.

Spendius, wounded, reappeared, leading Matho to Autaritus and Zarxas.  They discussed their situation—surrounded, defeated, betrayed.

Spendius devised a plan.  A runner arrived with news from Sardinia—a plot to free the captives.  This initially increased fear.

A second runner arrived—reinforcements were coming from Tunis.  Spendius, carried on shoulders, read the message repeatedly, rallying the Mercenaries.  He reminded them of Carthage's cruelty and the promises of the Great Council.

The stench of death was overwhelming.  Spendius pointed to Hamilcar; Matho, spurred by cowardice and anger, joined the renewed assault on the captives.

Gisco was found; he was killed and his head thrown into the Carthaginian camp.  Heralds declared an end to all mercy.  Spendius sought provisions; they ate, gathered their belongings, and marched on Hippo-Zarytus.

Hamilcar, despite his victory, felt despair.  He should have attacked immediately.  He sent the Great Council a message of victory and demanded reinforcements.

News of the victory stunned Carthage.  An army was quickly assembled.  Hanno, diseased and hideous, led the troops to Hippo-Zarytus.  Hippo-Zarytus supplied the Barbarians with food, while protesting to both sides.  Hanno blockaded the harbor.

News arrived of a Sardinian revolt, Roman threats, and a Carthaginian supply ship lost at sea.  Hippo-Zarytus killed Hanno's soldiers.  Magdassin, mimicking Hanno, betrayed Hamilcar.  The Tyrian towns joined the Barbarians.

Hope revived.  Hamilcar dismissed Narr' Havas and planned to return to Carthage for reinforcements.  The Barbarians saw his army descending, then realized they were fleeing.

The Carthaginians were stopped by a river; some swam, others used their shields.  They continued their flight; the Barbarians pursued.  They reached Carthage.  Matho, overcome with emotion, saw Carthage.

Spendius urged him forward.  Matho, overwhelmed by joy and longing for Salammbo, was nearly overcome.


## Rewritten pages 145–168

# 13. Chapter: Moloch

Matho, roused from his stupor by Hamilcar's triumphant air, felt a surge of vengeful despair.  He leaped onto a baggage camel, grabbed its halter, and, using the rope as a whip, furiously drove back the stragglers, like a shepherd herding sheep.

This thunderous action spurred the Carthaginian lines forward. Even the wounded hastened their pace, closing the gap on the isthmus.  The Barbarians marched into the dust kicked up by the Carthaginians.  The armies were about to clash.  But then, the Malqua, Tagaste, and Khamon gates swung open.  Three Carthaginian columns surged through, then stalled, their ranks too dense. Pikes clashed, Barbarian arrows shattered against the walls.

Hamilcar, at the Khamon gate, ordered his men to clear a path. Dismounting, he spurred his black stallion—a pampered creature that knelt for him to mount—into the enemy ranks. Was this a sacrifice? The horse galloped among the lances, fell, rose again, creating chaos.  The Carthaginians reformed, entered the city, and the massive gate thundered shut.  The Barbarians crashed against it, their advance momentarily stalled before finally halting.

Carthaginian soldiers on the aqueduct rained down stones and beams. Spendius advised against further attacks. The Barbarians retreated, resolved to besiege Carthage.

News of the war spread far and wide. From the Pillars of Hercules to beyond Cyrene, shepherds and caravans discussed Carthage's daring attackers.  Many longed for her fall—subject populations, tributary villages, allied provinces, and independent hordes, all fueled by hatred, jealousy, or greed.  The Macaras defeat had initially dampened the mercenaries' spirits, but their confidence returned. They advanced, and now, eastern forces lay on the Clypea sandhills across the gulf.

These were not nearby Libyans, but nomads from the Barca plateau, bandits from Cape Phiscus, Dernah, Phazzana, and Marmarica. They had crossed the desert, drinking at brackish wells marked by camel bones. Zuaeces, adorned with ostrich feathers, arrived in quadrigae; masked Garamantians rode painted mares; others rode asses, onagers, zebras, and buffaloes, some dragging their hut roofs, families, and idols.  Ammonians, Atarantians, Troglodytes, Auseans, Achyrmachidae, and Gysantians—each with their unique customs and appearances—formed a vast line along the sea.  They advanced like sandstorms.

The mercenaries near the walls refused to move against this throng. Then, from Ariana, came the western Numidians. Narr' Havas controlled only the Massylians, who, according to custom, had abandoned him after setbacks.  They had regrouped on the Zainus, crossing at Hamilcar's first move. Hunters from Malethut-Baal and Garaphos, clad in lionskins, led the way, driving lean horses.  Gaetulians in serpent-skin cuirasses followed, then Pharusians in wax-and-resin crowns, and finally, Caunians, Macarians, and Tillabarians. They halted at the Catacombs near the lagoon.

The Libyans moved aside, revealing a vast multitude of Negroes from the White Harousch, Black Harousch, the Augila desert, and even Agazymba, four months' journey south of the Garamantians. Despite their red wooden jewelry, their filth-covered skin resembled dusty mulberries.  They wore bark-thread drawers and dried-grass tunics, with fallow-deer muzzles on their heads. They shook ringed rods and brandished cows' tails as standards, howling like wolves.

Behind the Numidians, Marusians, and Gaetulians pressed yellowish men from beyond Taggir's cedar forests.  They carried cat-skin quivers and led huge, silent dogs.

Finally, as if Africa's fury wasn't enough, came the dregs of humanity: beast-like figures, deformed pigmies, androgynous mulattoes, and albinos, stammering and gesturing their hunger.

The weapons were as diverse as the people: from wooden daggers and stone hatchets to saw-toothed sabres and copper blades.  They wielded forked cutlasses, rope-bound bills, iron triangles, clubs, and bodkins.  Ethiopians hid poisoned darts in their hair. Some carried pebbles; others, nothing.

This ceaselessly surging multitude—dromedaries, women carrying children, provisions spilling from baskets—obscured the isthmus. The tents resembled huts in a flood, stretching to the Barbarians' lines flanking the aqueduct.

Before the Carthaginians recovered from the terror of this arrival, Tyrian siege engines appeared—sixty carroballistas, eighty onagers, thirty scorpions, fifty tollenos, twelve rams, and three gigantic catapults.  Men pushed these monstrous machines forward, their arrival shaking the earth.

Several days remained for siege preparations.  The mercenaries, wary after defeats, avoided rash engagements.  Both sides anticipated a decisive battle—total victory or annihilation.  Carthage's strong walls, with their advantageous angles, offered significant defense.  However, a section near the Catacombs had collapsed, revealing Malqua's dens and the Mercenaries' wives who had fled with their new husbands.

Spendius finally prepared his plan. The war had delayed him, and he sensed suspicion. But the aqueduct's sentries were reduced.  He practiced arrow shooting, then, one moonlit night, he and Zarxas, under cover of a Matho-ordered diversion, crept towards the aqueduct.

The sentries patrolled calmly.  Flames erupted, clarions blared, and the soldiers fled towards Carthage, leaving one man behind.  Spendius, instead of using a sling, aimed his arrow, killing the sentry. He then climbed the aqueduct, dropping the body.  A Balearian attached a pick and mallet to it.

Silence fell. Spendius opened a fissure in the aqueduct, working furiously for three hours until a crack appeared, and a torrent of water gushed out, crippling Carthage and securing Barbarian victory.

Carthaginians swarmed onto walls and rooftops. The Barbarians danced in delirious joy around the waterfall. Spendius, atop the aqueduct, surveyed his handiwork with haughty triumph, while Carthaginian despair echoed his victory.


# Moloch (Continued)

The Barbarians needed no circumvallation on the African side; it was theirs.  They leveled the entrenchments bordering the ditch to facilitate access to the walls. Matho arranged the army in semicircles to encircle Carthage. Mercenary hoplites formed the front line, followed by slingers and horsemen, with baggage and engines three hundred paces from the towers.

These engines fell into two categories: sling-like and bow-like.

* **Catapults:**  A square frame with vertical uprights and a horizontal bar. A cylinder with cables held back a beam with a projectile spoon. Releasing the ropes propelled the projectile.

* **Bow-like:** A more complex mechanism with a crossbar fixed to a pillar.  Horsehair twists at the crossbar ends held small beams connected to a rope in a bronze channel.  Releasing the bronze plate launched arrows.

Catapults were also called onagers, and ballistas scorpions.  Construction required precise calculations, hard wood, brass gearing, and levers.  They moved on cylinders, the largest assembled on-site.

Spendius positioned three catapults opposite key angles, a ram before each gate, a ballista before each tower, with carroballistas in the rear.  They needed protection from Carthaginian fire and had to fill the trench.

They used galleries of green reeds and oaken semicircles on wheels. Workers were sheltered in rawhide huts, catapults and ballistas behind vinegar-soaked rope curtains. Women and children gathered stones and earth.

The Carthaginians also prepared. Hamilcar reassured them, stating sufficient water remained for 123 days. His presence and the zaimph boosted morale.  Carthage rallied; non-Canaanites joined the effort. Slaves were armed, arsenals emptied, and every citizen had a role.  Twelve hundred survivors from the earlier fighting were made captains, and craftsmen repaired existing siege engines.

The northern and eastern sides, protected by the sea and gulf, remained inaccessible.  On the Barbarian-facing wall, they stockpiled tree trunks, millstones, sulfur, and oil, building furnaces.  Towers were piled with stones, and houses along the ramparts filled with sand for reinforcement.

The Barbarians, impatient for battle, used excessively heavy weights, breaking catapult beams, delaying the attack.

Finally, on the thirteenth day of Schabar, at sunrise, a great blow struck the Khamon gate. Seventy-five soldiers worked a massive ram, swathed in ox-hides and bound with iron, one hundred and twenty cubits long.  Other rams began moving.  Men climbed the tympanum wheels. Pulleys grated, rope curtains lowered, and stones and arrows flew. Slingers hurled resin pots.  Carthaginian cranes with giant pincers countered, pulling back the rams.  The struggle lasted until evening.

The next day, the walls were covered with cotton, sails, and cushions.  Forks and blades were fixed to the cranes.  The Carthaginians fought fiercely.  Trees battered the rams, ballista cramps tore hut roofs, and stones rained down.

The Khamon and Tagaste gates were breached, but blocked by debris.  Augers were used to detach stones.  The siege engines worked with relentless precision. Spendius meticulously tuned the ballistas, ensuring equal tension on both sides. He climbed the timbers, striking the ropes, his ear attuned to their sound, then flinging his arms in the air as the projectiles flew.

The machines failed to breach the double-walled, earth-filled rampart.  The upper sections were battered down, but constantly rebuilt. Matho ordered the construction of wooden towers as high as the stone ones.  They filled the trench with turf, stakes, pebbles, and chariots.  Before this was complete, the Barbarian horde surged forward, crashing against the walls.

Rope and straight ladders, and sambucas (two poles with bamboo bridges) were deployed.  Mercenaries climbed, facing no Carthaginian response.  Two-thirds of the rampart was covered.  Then, flames and smoke erupted from the battlements.  Sand, petroleum, and molten lead rained down.  Men burned, were extinguished with blood-soaked mantles.  Some remained motionless, their mouths open, arms outstretched.

The assault continued for days.  Men climbed using pins as steps, but always fell back. The trench overflowed with the wounded and dead.  Calcined trunks lay amid entrails and blood.

Ladders proving insufficient, tollenos were used—long beams with baskets holding thirty soldiers. Matho wanted to ascend first, but Spendius stopped him.  The tollenos rose, swung, and deposited soldiers onto the wall.  Ethiopian archers in suspended tollenos rained poisoned arrows.  Hamilcar countered with hoplites who drank antidotes.

Under cover of darkness, Hamilcar launched a flanking attack from the Taenia, causing great slaughter.  Carthaginians descended from the walls at night, burning the mercenaries' works.

Matho, enraged, doubled outposts, planted forks, and demanded a forest to burn Carthage. Spendius continued the siege, inventing new machines.  The other Barbarians, impatient, attacked, but were slaughtered.  Provisions dwindled, and many hordes left.

Mining attempts failed; Hamilcar detected them using a bronze shield. He countered with counter-mines.  It became clear that a high terrace was needed to match the wall height.

Carthage suffered from thirst. Water prices soared, food stores dwindled, and talk of eliminating "useless mouths" spread terror.  Corpses filled the streets.  Fictitious funerals were held for those who died far from home.  Waxen statues melted in the heat.  The city was a maelstrom of activity, punctuated by the constant battering of rams.

The heat caused bodies to swell, making burial impossible. They were burned, igniting nearby walls.  Moloch seemed to possess Carthage, consuming even the corpses.

Men in rags denounced the Ancients and Hamilcar, predicting ruin.  Henbane-drinkers, believing themselves beasts, attacked passersby.  The Suffet paid others to maintain order.

To appease the gods, their images were chained, altars veiled.  They sang to the Baals: "Are the others stronger? Show yourself! Aid us!"

The pontiffs were anxious, especially those of Rabbetna, despite the zaimph's presence.  Only Schahabarim ventured out, visiting Salammbo, either silent or showering her with harsh reproaches.  He blamed her for the war, believing Matho sought the zaimph.  But Salammbo felt no fear.  A strange peace had settled over her.

The python fell ill, while Salammbo recovered, Taanach believing the python's decline transferred its languor to her mistress.  Salammbo spent days on her terrace, observing the siege.  She remembered Schahabarim's words and awaited Narr' Havas, yet strangely, also wanted to see Matho again.

Hamilcar visited Salammbo, questioning her about her trip to the mercenary camp, subtly probing her time in Matho's tent.  She omitted Gisco, fearing curses, and her assassination plan, fearing blame.  She spoke only of the schalischim's fury and sleep.

One evening, Taanach brought an old man and a child who wished to see Hamilcar.  It was Iddibal, with Hamilcar's son, Hannibal.

Hannibal, about ten years old, surveyed the room with an intense gaze.  He wore a lynx skin.  Hamilcar instructed Salammbo to keep him hidden.  Iddibal assured him they hadn't been seen; he'd arrived by sloop, landing near the deserted Khamon gate.

The Barbarians blocked the harbor with a raft.  They rebuilt wooden towers, and the terrace rose.  Communications were severed, and famine intensified.

The besieged ate dogs, mules, asses, and finally, the fifteen elephants.  Moloch's lions, fed first with wounded Barbarians, then corpses, died. People foraged for food, sometimes sneaking into Barbarian tents.  The Ancients secretly slaughtered the sacred horses of Eschmoun, sharing the meat.  Inhabitants barricaded themselves in fear.

Siege debris filled the streets.  Sudden rushes of people, conflagrations, and the constant thud of rams marked the city.  Slinger bullets, bearing insults like "pig" and "jackal," fell everywhere.

The rampart near the harbors collapsed, leaving Malqua vulnerable.  They focused on strengthening the wall, abandoning Malqua's inhabitants. Hamilcar opened his grain stores, providing three days of feasting, but thirst intensified.

Hamilcar planned something decisive. His slaves stripped silver from Melkarth's temple.  Boats were sent to Gaul for mercenaries.  He was distressed at his inability to contact Narr' Havas.  He raised the rampart, stockpiled materials, and repaired the machines.

Bull sinews were needed for the catapults, but none were available.  The Ancients donated their wives' hair, but it was insufficient.  The Syssitia's slaves offered their hair, but the loss was too great.  Plebeian wives' hair was taken, causing outrage.

The Barbarians' fury increased.  They used dead bodies' fat to grease machines, made nail cuirasses, and hurled clay pots filled with serpents.  The plague returned.

The machines were positioned on the terrace, with wooden towers before the stone ones.  Spendius's helepolis, a massive siege tower, appeared. Hamilcar threatened death to those who spoke of surrender, even the women were put to work.

At sunrise on the seventh day of Nyssan, a massive Barbarian assault began.  Lances bristled, ladders scaled the walls, and rams battered the gates.  Mercenaries formed human shields to protect themselves from projectiles.  Carthaginians hurled everything they could find.  They even demolished their own battlements.  Catapults on the terrace fired at each other.

The two armies merged into a chaotic mass, swaying without advancing.  Women shrieked from the battlements, being dragged away and killed.  Corpses, pressed by the crowd, stood upright.  Arrows flew from towers, and tombstones from the old cemetery were hurled.  Tolleno cables snapped, dropping men from the sky.

Veterans attacked the Taenia, aiming to destroy the fleet.  Hamilcar used smoke to repel them.  Several gates were breached, but others held.  A Gaulish-style wall slowed the advance.

The Barbarians controlled the area from Khamon to the Green Market.  Slingers continued firing, but many threw stones by hand. Zarxas, his hair covering his shoulders, directed the Barbarians.

Matho, initially observing, was drawn into the battle by the carnage.  He donned his lion skin, and fought with furious efficiency.  He reached the second enclosure, rallied his men, but was overwhelmed and carried outside the ramparts.  He fought his way back, but Schahabarim cursed him from the wall.  Matho threw his axe, and Schahabarim was attacked.

The helepolis approached, its immense ram poised.  Soldiers emerged from its doors. Hamilcar, on Melkarth's roof, anticipated its attack on the undefended section.  He prepared a water trap on the terrace.

As the helepolis neared, water was poured onto the terrace, softening the ground.  The helepolis's wheels sank, and it tilted precariously.  The catapult fell, destroying lower stories.  Soldiers tumbled into the abyss.  The Barbarians rushed to help, but Carthaginians attacked from the rear.  Chariots encircled the crowd.  Night fell, and the Barbarians retreated.

The terrace was piled with corpses.  The damaged helepolis stood amidst the ruins.  The Carthaginians, desperate for water, found only mud in the cisterns.

The people debated—sending away the weak, abandoning the city.  But there were no ships.  Exhaustion brought a day of respite.

Reflecting on their disasters, they remembered the overdue offering to Melkarth.  Terror gripped them.  Moloch, the Devourer, demanded sacrifice—children were usually burned.  This time, the Republic itself was at stake.  The Ancients met, Hanno urging sacrifice of their own children.  Hamilcar agreed.

The decision spread, causing lamentations.  But then, Hamilcar announced the discovery of springs.  A rush to the springs ensued, but they soon dried up.  The sacrifice decree was enacted.

Men in black robes collected children.  Some parents fled, others surrendered their children.  The children were taken to Tanith's temple.

The priests came for Hamilcar's son.  Overwhelmed, he hid Hannibal under Salammbo's bed.  He then ordered Giddenem to bring a similar-looking slave child.  Giddenem brought a sickly child.

Abdalonim announced the priests' impatience.  Hamilcar washed the child, dressed him in Salammbo's clothes, and prepared him for sacrifice.  A distraught slave revealed himself as the child's father.  Hamilcar, unmoved, continued.

The priests waited.  Hamilcar, overcome with grief, cried out for his son.  The slave father appeared, crying "My child!" Hamilcar drove the priests away, then sent the slave food.

Hamilcar freed Hannibal, who bit him.  Salammbo tried to calm him with tales of Lamia.  Hamilcar told him the truth.  Hannibal, enraged, boasted of his power.  He fell asleep.

Hamilcar took Hannibal to a secret underground passage leading to the beach.  He embraced his son, weeping and laughing.  He returned, finding the slave asleep.  He covered him with a carpet, and looked to Tanith, feeling stronger than the Baals.

The sacrifice preparations began.  Moloch was moved to the Khamon square.  The Carthaginians fled at his appearance.  Aromatic smells filled the air.  Temples opened, releasing their Baalim in processions.

Melkarth's pavilion held a petroleum flare; Khamon's, an ivory phallus; Eschmoun's, a python; and the Pataec gods were carried.  Other gods and symbols were present—Baal-Samin, Baal-Peor, Baal-Zeboub, Iarbal, Adramelech, Kijun, Derceto, Tammouz, and constellations.  Incense burned.  The procession moved slowly.

The brazen Moloch arrived in the square.  His priests formed an enclosure.  Priests of Khamon, Eschmoun, Melkarth, and the Abbadirs took their places, along with necromancers and Yidonim.  Ceres' priests chanted.

Naked men, chanting and swaying, were forced to lie down before Moloch.  Schahabarim, a Tanith priest, approached, causing outrage.


## Rewritten pages 169–192

# Chapter 14: The Pass of the Hatchet

The priests of Moloch were outraged.  They gestured wildly, trying to repel Schahabarim, who had offered no victims to their god.  Clad in purple, crowned, and feasting on sacrificial meat, they sneered at the pale, self-mortifying eunuch. Angry laughter shook their sun-drenched beards.

Schahabarim ignored them.  He deliberately crossed the enclosure, reached the colossus, and touched it on both sides—a solemn act of worship.  Long tormented by doubt, he'd finally chosen this god.

The crowd murmured in terror.  Their last connection to a merciful deity felt severed.  But Schahabarim's mutilation barred him from Baal's cult.  The priests in red cloaks expelled him.  He then silently passed through the colleges, a godless priest vanishing into the scattering crowd.

Meanwhile, a fire of aloes, cedar, and laurel burned between the colossus's legs.  Its wings dipped into the flames; unguents flowed like sweat.  Children, veiled in black, formed a motionless circle around the flagstone beneath its feet.  The colossus's immense arms reached down, as if to grasp their crown-like formation and lift it to the heavens.

The rich, elders, women—the entire multitude—crowded behind the priests and on the house terraces.  The painted stars stood still.  Incense rose in bluish plumes, like gigantic trees against the azure sky.

Many fainted; others were petrified in ecstasy.  Infinite anguish gripped the onlookers.  The last shouts died away, leaving only breathless, terrified anticipation.

The high priest passed his hand beneath the children's veils, plucked a lock of hair, and tossed it into the flames.  The priests in red chanted:

* “Homage to thee, Sun! King of the two zones, self-generating Creator, Father and Mother, Father and Son, God and Goddess, Goddess and God!”

Their voices were drowned out by a cacophony of instruments: eight-stringed scheminiths, ten-stringed kinnors, twelve-stringed nebals, leathern pipes, tabourines, clarions, and salsalim.

Hierodules used a hook to open the Baal's seven compartments. They placed:

* Meal in the highest.
* Two turtle-doves in the second.
* An ape in the third.
* A ram in the fourth.
* A sheep in the fifth.
* A tawny hide in the sixth (no ox was available).

The seventh remained empty.

First, they tested the god's arms.  Chainlets stretched from its fingers to shoulders.  Men pulled these, raising the arms in jerky movements.

The music stopped. The fire roared.

The priests scanned the multitude. A voluntary sacrifice was needed to carry the others along.  None came forward.  The seven passages to the colossus remained empty.

To encourage the people, the priests gashed their faces.  Devotees were brought in, given irons, and chose their own tortures:  spits, self-inflicted wounds, thorn crowns. They formed a writhing circle around the children, their movements attracting the crowd with their blood and screams.

Slowly, people entered the passages, throwing pearls, gold, and torches into the flames.  Finally, a terrified man offered a child.  The small form disappeared into the colossus's dark opening.  A new song celebrated death and eternal rebirth.

The children ascended slowly, seemingly disappearing in the swirling smoke.  Their bound wrists and ankles, and concealing veils, prevented identification.

Hamilcar, in a red cloak, stood beside the Baal.  When the fourteenth child arrived, he showed horror, but quickly resumed his impassive stance. The high priest, similarly still, watched the iridescent flames reflected in his fatidical breastplate.

The brazen arms moved faster, ceaselessly.  With each child, the priests laid hands on it, crying, “They are not men but oxen!” The crowd echoed, “Oxen! Oxen!” Devotees cried, “Lord! Eat!”  Proserpine's priests muttered the Eleusinian formula: “Pour out rain! Bring forth!”

The victims vanished instantly, leaving only white smoke amidst the scarlet.  The god's appetite remained insatiable.  To feed it, victims were piled onto its hands, held in place by a chain.  Attempts to count them, to match the solar year, were abandoned as more arrived.  This continued until evening.  The compartments glowed darker, revealing burning flesh, hair, and limbs.

Night fell; clouds gathered. The fire dwindled to a blood-red pyramid of coals. The colossus, head thrown back, seemed to stagger under its burden of intoxication.

The priests' haste fueled the people's frenzy.  As victims dwindled, some cried to spare them, others for more. The walls groaned under the howls of terror and mystic ecstasy.  The faithful dragged their clinging children, beating them to release them for the priests in red.  The musicians faltered; mothers' cries and the sizzling of fat filled the gaps.  Henbane-drinkers crawled, roaring; the Yidonim prophesied; the Devotees sang; the barriers were breached; all craved participation.  Parents threw effigies, toys, and preserved bones into the fire.  Some, wielding knives, attacked others.  Hierodules scattered the ashes with bronze fans, spreading the sacrifice over the city and towards the stars.

The spectacle attracted Barbarians to the walls, clinging to the helepolis for a better view.


The Carthaginians hadn't reached their homes when heavier clouds gathered.  Rain began to fall, a deluge lasting all night. Thunder roared—Moloch's voice. He had conquered Tanith; she, now fecundated, opened her vast bosom in the heavens.  Occasionally, she appeared in a luminous spot, then vanished into the darkness, seemingly weary. The Carthaginians, believing the moon brought forth water, shouted to ease her travail.

Rain flooded the terraces, creating lakes in courtyards, cascades on staircases, and eddies in the streets.  Torrents rushed from the Acropolis.  Houses collapsed, sending debris into the rushing water.  Torches were extinguished; brands from the Baal's pyre were used to drink. People plunged into muddy pools, drinking until they vomited.  The freshness brought relief, boundless hope replacing misery.  Their country was reborn.

A need arose to unleash their fury on others.  The sacrifice couldn't be in vain; though remorse was absent, the frenzy of complicity overwhelmed them.

The Barbarians, chilled in their tents, searched for ruined stores and weapons the following day.

Hamilcar gave Hanno command, entrusting him with plenary powers.  Hanno, after brief hesitation, accepted.

Hamilcar took a galley, equipped with catapults, placed it before the raft, and embarked his strongest troops.  He seemingly fled north, disappearing into the mist.

Three days later, as the attack resumed, Libyans arrived. Barca had gathered provisions and was spreading through the land.

The Barbarians were indignant, accusing him of betrayal.  The weariest, especially the Gauls, deserted to join him.  Spendius planned to rebuild the helepolis; Matho plotted a route to Megara; their men remained.  But Autaritus's forces abandoned the western ramparts, leaving them undefended.

Narr' Havas spied them from the mountains.  He led his six thousand men, carrying hidden grain, and forty elephants laden with supplies, into Carthage during the night.  The people welcomed them, giving the elephants names.  These animals, sacred to Baal, brought even greater joy than the supplies—a sign of the god's intervention.

Narr' Havas received compliments from the elders and then went to Salammbo's palace.  He hadn't seen her since their brief handclasp in Hamilcar's tent.  His ambitions had diverted him, but his love returned.  He expected to claim his rights, to marry her.

Salammbo couldn't comprehend his mastery over her.  Though she daily prayed for Matho's death, her horror of the Libyan lessened.  She sensed a religious quality in his persecution, seeing a reflection of that malice in Narr' Havas.  She desired to know him better, yet his presence embarrassed her.  She refused an audience.

Hamilcar forbade Narr' Havas from seeing Salammbo, hoping to retain his loyalty until war's end.  Fearing the Suffet, Narr' Havas withdrew.

He treated the Hundred haughtily, changing their arrangements, demanding privileges for his men, and placing them in key positions.  The Barbarians were astonished to see Numidians on the towers.

The Carthaginians were even more surprised by the arrival of three hundred prisoners of war from Sicily. Hamilcar had secretly returned the crews of Latin ships captured before the Tyrian defection.  Rome reciprocated by sending back its captives.  Rome scorned the mercenaries' overtures and refused to recognize Utica's inhabitants as subjects.

Hiero of Syracuse followed suit.  To maintain balance, he aided the Canaanites, declaring friendship and sending twelve hundred oxen and fifty-three thousand nebels of wheat.

A deeper reason prompted the aid.  A mercenary victory meant universal revolt, threatening all government and homes.

Hamilcar scoured the eastern districts, driving back the Gauls.  The Barbarians found themselves besieged.  Hamilcar's strategy of attack and retreat gradually separated them from their encampments.  Spendius and Matho were forced to follow.

Matho remained in Tunis.  This proved wise, as Narr' Havas soon emerged with his elephants and soldiers.  Hamilcar recalled him, but other Barbarians pursued the Suffet.

Hamilcar received reinforcements: three thousand Gauls, horses from Cyrenaica, and armor from Brutium.  He renewed the war with renewed vigor.

The Barbarians initially used small detachments to surround him, but he evaded them.  They united their forty thousand men, several times witnessing Carthaginian retreats.

Narr' Havas's horsemen were most tormenting.  During rests, a dust cloud would appear on the horizon.  Numidians in white cloaks would attack with javelins, then vanish, returning with fresh supplies and dromedaries.  Barbarians at the flanks fell one by one until evening, when they sought refuge in the mountains.

Despite the danger to elephants, Hamilcar ventured into the mountains, following the chain from Hermaeum to Zagouan.  This was seen as a ruse to hide his weakness, but the constant uncertainty exasperated them more than any defeat.  They pressed on.

One evening, they surprised velites near a pass between the Silver and Lead Mountains.  The sound of clarions indicated the main Carthaginian force.  The velites fled through the gorge, a hatchet-shaped valley surrounded by cliffs.  The Barbarians pursued, seeing Hamilcar himself.

Some Barbarians remained at the pass entrance.  Carthaginian cavalry emerged from a wood, driving them down into the plain.  They found themselves trapped.

Those near the pass retreated, but the passage vanished.  They were crushed against the mountain, unable to find the way back.  The Carthaginians had rolled down rocks, blocking the passage.

Another passage led to a ravine ascending to the plateau where the Punic army waited.  Ladders were in place; velites climbed them before being overtaken.  A forty-cubit portcullis descended, barring their escape.

Hamilcar's plan had succeeded.  The Barbarians, unfamiliar with the mountains, had led themselves into a trap.  The rocks were easily dislodged.  While the Barbarians were running, the Carthaginian army raised cries of distress.  Hamilcar had lost some velites, but considered it a worthwhile sacrifice.

The Barbarians pressed against the mountain, searching for an escape.  At daybreak, they saw a high wall.  They were trapped.  The portcullis and rocks blocked their escape.

They collapsed, feeling icy coldness and overwhelming weight.  They rose and hurled themselves against the rocks, but were crushed.  They tried to climb, but the rock's shape prevented it.  Their tools broke.  A fire couldn't burn the mountain.

They turned to the portcullis, covered in sharp nails.  Their rage drove them against it; the first were impaled, the others fell over them, leaving blood and hair on the spikes.

Their discouragement lessened, they checked their supplies.  The mercenaries, having lost their baggage, had only enough for two days.  The others were destitute, awaiting a promised convoy.

They killed and ate roaming bulls.  Then they slaughtered forty mules, scraping the skins, boiling the entrails, and pounding the bones.  They hoped for the army from Tunis.

By the fifth day, hunger intensified.  They gnawed their belts and helmet sponges.

Forty thousand men crowded the valley.  Some remained before the portcullis or rocks; others covered the plain.  The strong shunned each other; the timid sought the brave, who couldn't save them.

The velites' corpses were buried; their graves were no longer visible.  The Barbarians lay listless.  Veterans passed, hearing curses against the Carthaginians, Hamilcar, and Matho.  They groaned and wept.

They begged their captains for relief.  Some responded with fury, throwing stones.

Some had hidden food—dates or meal—eating it secretly at night.  Those with swords kept them ready.  The suspicious remained standing.

They accused and threatened their leaders.  Autaritus, undeterred, repeatedly checked the rocks, hoping for a shift.  Spendius, surrounded by Greeks, hid, spreading rumors of his death.

They were emaciated, their skin bluish.  On the ninth day, three Iberians died.  Their bodies were stripped and left in the sun.

The Garamantians, revering no god, approached.  The oldest made a sign; they cut strips from the corpses and ate.  Others watched in horror, yet envied their courage.

More approached, asking for a taste.  Their numbers swelled.  Many recoiled at the cold flesh, but others devoured it.  They urged each other on.  Those who refused returned no more.  They cooked the flesh, salted it with dust, and fought over the morsels.  When the corpses were gone, they sought others.

Twenty Carthaginian captives were discovered.  They were killed and eaten—an act of vengeance.  The need for food, and the taste for it, led them to kill water carriers and servants.

Some ate well, regaining strength.  This resource failed.  The wounded and sick became the next target.  They were robbed of their meager rations, trampled, and their last efforts to appear strong were met with blades.  Men revived only to have limbs severed.  They killed needlessly, to sate their fury.

A heavy mist descended on the fourteenth day.  Many died; corruption spread rapidly.  The drizzle softened the corpses, turning the plain into a rotting expanse.  Whitish vapors pricked nostrils, troubled sight; the Barbarians believed they saw the souls of their companions.  Overwhelmed by disgust, they wished only to die.

Fine weather returned two days later, bringing renewed hunger.  They convulsed, ate dust, bit their arms, and laughed frantically.  Thirst tormented them; their waterskins were empty.  They licked their belts, pommels, and swords.  Some tightened their belts; others sucked pebbles; they drank urine cooled in their helmets.

They still awaited the army from Tunis.  The delay, they reasoned, meant imminent arrival.  Matho wouldn't abandon them.  "Tomorrow," they repeated, as each day passed.

Initially, they prayed and performed incantations.  Now, they hated their gods, seeking revenge by rejecting them.

The violent died first; Africans outlasted the Gauls.  Zarxas lay inert.  Spendius found a plant, claiming it was poisonous to deter others, and ate it.

They were too weak to kill crows.  They would crawl towards a gypaetus on a corpse, throw a javelin, and fall in despair as the bird returned.  They found chameleons and snakes.  The will to live sustained them.

The stoical sat in circles among the dead, silently grieving.  Those from towns recalled streets, taverns, and theaters.  Others saw sunsets, oxen, and battles.  In their drowsiness, thoughts jumbled.  Hallucinations came—doors in the mountain, storms at sea, Punic battalions in the clouds, feasts, and songs.

Many repeated words or gestures.  Seeing each other's ravaged faces brought sobs.  Some, beyond suffering, recounted escapes.  Death was certain.  They had tried to escape; how could they negotiate?  They didn't know Hamilcar's location.

The wind blew sand over the portcullis.  The mountain seemed higher each morning.  Birds flew freely; the men closed their eyes.

A buzzing in ears, black nails, coldness in breasts—they expired silently.

By the nineteenth day, twenty thousand soldiers—half the army—were dead.

Autaritus, with fifty Gauls remaining, considered suicide, when he saw a figure on the mountain.  It was a Carthaginian, identified by a trefoil shield.  Hope surged.

The soldier walked along the precipice.  Spendius made a peace offering—an ox head on a pole adorned with belts.  The Carthaginian disappeared.

A sword-belt fell—Hamilcar's safe-conduct.  They were safe.  Joy overwhelmed them.  Spendius, Autaritus, Zarxas, and others offered themselves as envoys.  They didn't know how to escape.

Rocks began to fall.  The Carthaginians dislodged them, creating a makeshift staircase.  Ladders were offered; only ten were chosen.

They walked among Clinabarians, leaning on horses.  Their joy faded; Hamilcar's demands would be harsh.  Spendius reassured them, boasting of his persuasive skills.

Sentries prostrated themselves before Spendius's sword-belt.  In Hamilcar's tent, the envoys were examined. Their appearance was horrifying—emaciated, gaunt, and reeking.  A dish of gourds was offered; they devoured it.

Hamilcar gestured for Spendius to speak.  Spendius stammered, then recovered his servile habits, picking up a dropped ring.  The others were indignant.

Spendius spoke at length, accusing Hanno and appealing to Hamilcar's pity.  Hamilcar accepted their excuses; peace was at hand.  He demanded ten mercenaries.

They hadn't expected such clemency.  Spendius offered twenty.  Hamilcar insisted on ten.

They deliberated.  Autaritus protested; Zarxas questioned Spendius's inaction.  Spendius insisted on Hamilcar's invincibility.

Exhausted, they consented.  Hamilcar touched their thumbs, noting their skin's texture.  He confirmed their authority and oaths.  He then announced that he had chosen them to keep.

Spendius fainted.  The others remained silent.  Their companions, believing them betrayed, waited two days.

Using ropes, picks, and arrows, they scaled the rocks, leaving three thousand behind.  They marched towards Tunis.

They found buds and beans, quickly consuming them.  They reached a plateau, seeing elephants advancing.

The elephants were heavily armed.  The Barbarians were paralyzed by terror.  The elephants charged, crushing the mercenaries.  Narr' Havas controlled the carnage.  Two syntagmata surrendered.

The elephants trampled the prisoners.  Night fell.  Hamilcar, witnessing his vengeance, was startled by more Barbarians on a peak.  Four hundred mercenaries had remained, now descending.

A herald was sent.  Hamilcar needed soldiers; he accepted them unconditionally, offering provisions.

The Barbarians ate, then the Carthaginians protested Hamilcar's favoritism.  Was it treachery or a refinement of it?

Hamilcar, unarmed and bareheaded, announced that he had too many to feed.  They must fight to the death; the victors would join his guard.  He revealed Narr' Havas's elephants, forming a line, their trunks wielding blades.

The Barbarians were silent, pale not from death, but from the forced choice.  Their shared lives had created deep bonds.  The camp was their home; they loved each other.  They had formed attachments through shared experiences.

They exchanged gifts from past perils or celebrations.  All wished to die; none would strike.  They argued over who should die.  Brothers embraced; friends wept.

They removed their armor.  They stood in ranks, beginning timidly.  Some blindfolded themselves.  The Carthaginians taunted them; they fought fiercely.

Pairs stopped, embraced, and died together.  None retreated.  Their frenzy terrified the Carthaginians.  Sixty remained.  They were given water, then killed by Carthaginians.

Hamilcar had done this to appease his army and bind it to him.  The war was over—or so he thought.  Matho wouldn't resist.  Hamilcar ordered a departure.

Scouts reported a convoy heading towards the Lead Mountain.  Hamilcar ignored it.  Tunis was the priority.

Narr' Havas brought news of the victory.  He visited Salammbo, who received him in her gardens.

He recounted the battle.  Doves cooed; birds fluttered.  The garden, overgrown, was lush.  Animals roamed freely.  The city's clamor was lost in the waves.  The sky was blue; the sea was empty.

Salammbo watched Narr' Havas.  He was graceful, seeming like a protective sister.  She thought of Matho.  Narr' Havas said the Carthaginians were advancing on Tunis.  Salammbo rejoiced.  She urged him to kill Matho.  He promised, hoping for her hand in marriage.

He compared his longing to flowers and lost travelers.  He praised her beauty, promising gifts from the Black country.

Evening fell.  They looked at each other silently.  He left.

The elders were relieved.  The people acclaimed him.  Hanno, to weaken Barca, was made a participant in Carthage's deliverance.

He sought vengeance in the west, but found only ruins and fleeing people.  His anger turned on the land.  He burned ruins, tortured children, and gave women to his soldiers.

Fleeing tribes wandered, awaiting a mercenary victory.  Famine and fear drove them home.

Hamilcar wasn't jealous of Hanno's success, but urged him to Tunis.  Hanno arrived as planned.

Tunis had its population, mercenaries, and the Eaters of Uncleanness.  They prepared for a final stand.  Their ramparts were weak; Matho repaired them.

A man stood on the ramparts, untouched by arrows.  Hamilcar, Narr' Havas, and Hanno prepared a simultaneous attack.

Hamilcar crucified the ten ambassadors.  The besieged abandoned the ramparts.

Matho, hoping to attack the Carthaginian rear, charged with his veterans.  Narr' Havas warned Hanno, who, desiring to humiliate Hamilcar, attacked.  The mercenaries drove back the Carthaginians, reaching Hanno's tent.

Hanno was overwhelmed.  He pleaded for mercy, offering riches.  He was dragged away.  He was taken to a cross.  He offered to betray Hamilcar, proposing joint rule of Carthage.

Matho sent for him, suspecting a ruse.  Hanno, desperate and hating Hamilcar, was sincere.  The elders were bound.  Hanno wept as his clothes were torn, revealing his diseased body.

They nailed him to the cross.  His pride fueled his curses.  He was avenged—the mercenaries were dying on crosses.

Some revived, only to feel thirst and icy sweat.  They saw glimpses of battle.  The Italiotes shrieked; the Lacedaemonians were silent; Zarxas bent; Autaritus roared; Spendius awaited death impassively.

Vultures circled.  Spendius recalled the lions of Sicca.  The Gaul agreed.

Hamilcar breached the walls.  He saw thirty crosses on the shore—the elders.  Hanno was barely recognizable.

Fugitives reported the rout; the Punic army halted.  Matho ravaged the Numidians.  The elephants were driven into the gulf.  Narr' Havas's cavalry attacked; half perished.  The mercenaries retreated to the Hot Springs.  Hamilcar didn't pursue, taking Tunis—a smoking ruin.

Narr' Havas's elephants were lost.  People mourned.  The mercenaries were on the Hot Springs mountain.  Despair led many to suicide.

Hamilcar's plans were secret.  He lived alone.  He showed deference to Narr' Havas, but the king distrusted him.

Hamilcar's maneuvers were subtle.  He seduced village leaders; the mercenaries were hunted.  Their former allies pursued them.  Many believed they were afflicted for touching Hanno or eating Salammbo's fish.

They lingered for three months, finally returning to the gorges of Cobus.  Both sides were weary, preferring a final battle.

Matho sent a Libyan to propose a battle.  He returned; Hamilcar accepted, setting the time and place.  The Libyan recounted Hamilcar's words: "Begone! That will be tomorrow with the rest."

The mercenaries were astonished.  Matho regretted the Libyan's survival.

He had seven thousand soldiers.  They repaired their armor.  The spirits of their dead fueled them.  They felt themselves agents of vengeance.  They swore to fight to the death.

The Carthaginians arrived first, preparing for battle.  Hamilcar ordered bowls inverted.  His army was double the mercenaries'.  He felt anxiety; defeat meant annihilation.  He inspected everything.  The Carthaginians were desperate.  Narr' Havas's loyalty was questionable.

A stranger entered Hamilcar's tent, leaving a rock-salt crown—a marriage gift.  Salammbo felt no tenderness for Narr' Havas.  Matho's memory tormented her; his death would ease her mind.  She sent the crown to Narr' Havas to encourage him.

Matho rejected such thoughts, focusing his love on his companions.  He arranged his army.

Hamilcar arranged his forces similarly.  At dawn, they faced each other.  Hesitation, then a clash.  The mercenaries opened ranks; archers fired.  The Carthaginian line straightened, then bent inward.  The mercenaries charged, then retreated.

The mercenaries' flanks were weak.  Matho retreated them.  He sent Campanians against the Carthaginian left.  The center attacked; the right held the velites.

Hamilcar sent cavalry against the mercenaries.  The mercenaries couldn't resist.  Only the Greeks had good armor.  The Carthaginians slaughtered them.

The Etruscans, bound by a chain, held firm.  Their dead formed a barrier.  The line moved like a serpent.  Mercenaries reformed, then charged again.  Some fought with bare hands.  The Gauls stripped, showing their wounds.

Hamilcar sent the Numidians.  The Naffurs charged, wielding their unique weapons.  Their camels attacked, causing chaos.  The Punic infantry cut them off.  Mercenaries took Carthaginian armor and rejoined the fight.

The Carthaginians were surrounded.  They were entangled, then broke free.  The battle raged.

# Chapter 15: Matho

The distance felt endless, a storm battering Hamilcar and his men.  Despair mounted; all seemed lost to Matho's genius and the mercenaries' courage.

But then, a great sound—tabourines—on the horizon.  A throng of the elderly, sick, children, even women, overwhelmed by their plight, streamed from Carthage. Seeking protection, they carried Hamilcar's palace's only remaining elephant—the one with its trunk cut off.

This sight ignited the Carthaginians.  Their city, it seemed, had come to command their deaths. Fury surged; the Numidians were routed.

The mercenaries stood back-to-back against a hilltop.  Victory was impossible, survival unlikely, yet they were the best, the bravest, the strongest.

The Carthaginians hurled spits, pins, and hammers over the Numidians' heads.  Consuls' feared foes fell to women's sticks. The Punic mob was annihilating the mercenaries.

The mercenaries retreated to the hilltop. Their ranks reformed after each breach, twice driven back, then repulsed. The Carthaginians surged forward, pikes thrust between comrades, slashing wildly. They slipped in blood; the slope sent corpses tumbling. The elephant, struggling uphill, was belly-deep in the carnage, seemingly delighting in its macabre progress. Its shortened trunk, broad at the end, rose like a monstrous leech.

A pause.  The Carthaginians ground their teeth, staring at the hilltop.

Then, a final charge. The mercenaries feigned surrender, then, with cruel mockery, fell fighting. As they died, others climbed on their bodies, creating a growing pyramid of defiance.

Soon, only fifty remained, then twenty, three, finally two—a Samnite with an axe, and Matho, sword in hand.

The Samnite, legs bent, swept his axe, warning Matho of incoming blows.  "Master, this way! That way! Stoop!"

Matho was stripped bare, more livid than the dead, hair on end, foam at his lips. His sword whirled, a shimmering halo, until a stone shattered it. The Samnite fell. The Carthaginians closed in, touching Matho. He raised empty hands to heaven, closed his eyes, and flung himself onto their pikes, a defiant leap.

They recoiled. He crashed against them repeatedly, but they yielded, turning aside their weapons. His foot struck a sword; he tried to grasp it.  He was bound at wrists and knees, and fell.

Narr' Havas, trailing him, used a large hunting net to ensnare the stooping Matho.

Bound, limbs outstretched like a cross, to an elephant, Matho was escorted back to Carthage amidst a tumultuous throng.

News of the victory reached the city inexplicably by the third hour.  The Khamon clepsydra marked the fifth as they reached Malqua. Matho opened his eyes.  Carthage blazed with light.

A distant roar reached him; he gazed at the stars. A door closed; darkness fell.

The next day, at the same hour, the last mercenary in the Pass of the Hatchet died.

Earlier, returning Zuaeces had blocked the pass with rocks, sustaining them for a time.  Despair, sickness, and stubbornness kept the remaining mercenaries there, until their supplies ran out and the Zuaeces left.  Their number: barely thirteen hundred.  No army was needed to finish them.

Wild beasts, especially lions, had multiplied during the war. Narr' Havas had driven them towards the Pass of the Hatchet using goats as bait.  They now feasted there, when a scout arrived to assess the mercenaries' remains.

Lions and corpses littered the plain. The dead were mingled with clothing and armor. Many were mutilated; some intact, others desiccated, skulls powdering their helmets.  Skeletal legs protruded from greaves; cloaks clung to bones, gleaming white in the sand.

Lions rested, their eyes half-closed in the bright sunlight. Others watched, or slept curled in their manes, sated, weary, dull.  Immobile as the mountain, as the dead. Night fell, the western sky ablaze.

From a corpse-heap, something stirred, vaguer than a ghost. A lion sprang, its shadow falling across the purple sky.  It struck the scout down, then slowly devoured his entrails.  A long roar echoed through the mountains, then silence.

Gravel tumbled.  Rapid steps. Jackals, with gleaming eyes, appeared, drawn by the scent of death.  The watching Carthaginian retreated.


# Carthage Rejoices

Carthage rejoiced—wildly, universally. Ruins were repaired, statues repainted, streets strewn with myrtle. Incense burned, the terraces thronged with color.

Water-carriers' calls rose above the shouts. Hamilcar's slaves offered barley and meat. People embraced, wept.  The Tyrian towns were taken, nomads scattered, the Barbarians annihilated.  The Acropolis was draped in colored velaria; triremes gleamed like a diamond wall. Order was restored, a new era dawned, happiness reigned. It was Salammbo's wedding day to the Numidian king.

Three long tables laden with feasts awaited priests, Ancients, and the wealthy. A higher table was set for Hamilcar, Narr' Havas, and Salammbo.  Her role in saving Carthage with the zaimph made her wedding a national celebration.  The people waited below.

But another desire burned—Matho's death.

Proposals for his execution abounded: flaying, molten lead, starvation, an ape pelting him with stones.  He had offended Tanith; her cynocephaluses would avenge her.  Others suggested a dromedary, oil-soaked wicks burning in his body—a living candelabrum.

But how to share the torture?  Every citizen craved a role.  The Ancients decided: Matho would walk unescorted, arms bound, to Khamon Square.  No fatal blows, no blinding, no hurled objects—only three fingers at a time.

Though his appearance was hours away, the crowd surged towards the Acropolis at any hint of his presence. Some had waited since the previous day, sharpening their nails. Others paced, pale with anticipation.

Suddenly, feather fans appeared. Salammbo emerged. A sigh of relief swept the crowd.

The procession was slow, deliberate. Priests of the Pataec Gods led, followed by those of Eschmoun, Melkarth, and others, in ritual order.  The priests of Moloch passed with bowed heads, eliciting remorse.  The priests of Rabbetna strode proudly, lyres in hand, followed by priestesses in transparent robes, their cries and movements mimicking birds and vipers, their dance mirroring the stars.

The Kedeschim, with painted eyelids, representing the divinity's hermaphroditism, were applauded.  Their perfume and dress blurred the lines between genders.  A mystic sensuality filled the air. Torches burned in the sacred woods; a great night-long celebration was planned. Courtesans arrived from Sicily and the desert.

The colleges assembled in temple courts, galleries, and staircases. White robes filled the colonnades.  Then came the masters of the exchequer, governors, and the wealthy.  The crowd surged, hierodules pushing back the masses.  Salammbo appeared, carried in a litter, surrounded by tiara-crowned Ancients.

A roar erupted. Cymbals and tabourines thundered.  Salammbo's litter descended, then reappeared.  She walked beneath the canopy, taking her seat on a tortoise-shell throne.  Two Negro children knelt, supporting her ring-laden arms.

Fish-scale netting, shimmering like mother-of-pearl, covered her from hip to ankle. A blue zone cinched her waist, revealing her breasts, carbuncle pendants concealing her nipples.  Peacock feathers, studded with gems, adorned her head. A white cloak flowed behind her.  She sat upright, hieratic.

Her father and husband sat below—Narr' Havas in a light simar and rock-salt crown, Hamilcar in a violet tunic and battle-sword.

Eschmoun's temple python coiled in pink oil, forming a black circle around a crystal egg on a copper pillar. Sunlight radiated from it.

Tanith's priests stood behind Salammbo. Ancients in gold, the wealthy in emerald, and Moloch's priests in purple formed a vibrant backdrop.  The crowd filled the streets, rooftops, and Acropolis. Salammbo, in her splendor, was one with Tanith, the very spirit of Carthage.

The feast would last all night. Lamps illuminated the tables, laden with electrum flagons, amphoras, tortoise-shell spoons, and loaves. Grapes entwined ivory vine-stocks. Snow melted on ebony trays.  Fruits formed colorful mounds.  Boars, hares, and elaborate pastries adorned the tables.  Doves flew from opened dishes.

Slaves moved silently. Hymns and choruses rose above the continuous murmur of the crowd, a sound like the sea.  Some recalled the mercenaries' feast, lost in dreams of happiness. The sun dipped, the moon rose.

Salammbo turned. The crowd followed her gaze.

The dungeon door opened.  Matho stood in the black doorway, blinded by the light.  The crowd held its breath.

He was theirs, a sacred victim.  They leaned forward, especially the women, consumed by a morbid curiosity, a mixture of hatred and remorse.

He moved.  Arms rose, obscuring him.  He descended the sixty steps of the Acropolis like a torrent, leaping, landing on his feet.

His shoulders bled, his chest heaved.  He strained against his bonds, his arms swelling.  Bronze chains stretched across the streets, the crowd pressed against the houses, servants wielding thongs.

They pushed him forward, complaining the path was too wide.  Fingers pricked, slashed, tore at him.  He lunged, biting, but the chains held him.  The crowd laughed.

A child tore his ear, a girl slashed his cheek.  They pulled his hair, tore his flesh, smeared his face with filth.  Blood flowed, frenzy erupted.  He was the embodiment of all their enemies, their suffering, their shame.  Their rage grew with each blow.  The chains strained, threatening to break.  The crowd pressed forward, howling their abuse.

The baying was relentless, a single, hoarse cry echoing for minutes, shaking the walls.  Matho felt the city rising to crush him.

Yet, a memory surfaced—the same crowd, the same rage, but then he had been free, protected by a god.  Sadness overwhelmed him.  Shadows danced before his eyes.  The city spun.  His blood flowed, he felt himself dying, his legs gave way, he sank gently.

A red-hot tripod bar was pressed against his wound.  Flesh smoked.  The cries drowned his voice.  He rose.

He fell three more times, but new tortures always revived him.  Boiling oil, broken glass—still he walked.  At Satheb Street, he leaned against a wall, unable to continue.

Council slaves lashed him with hippopotamus-hide whips, until their tunics were soaked with sweat.  Matho seemed insensible, then he ran, lips chattering.  He crossed streets, reached Khamon Square.

He was now the priests'.  The slaves cleared the crowd.  Matho looked up, and saw Salammbo.

She had risen at his first step, then moved to the terrace's edge.  All else faded, only Matho remained.  Silence fell, a vast emptiness where a single thought reigned—this man, drawing her in.

He was barely human—a long, red shape, broken bonds hanging, tendons exposed, mouth agape, eyes blazing.  He walked on.

He reached the terrace. Salammbo leaned over, his eyes burning into her, a vision of his suffering for her.  She saw him kneeling, his arms around her, whispering gentle words.  She wanted him to live.

He stumbled.  She almost screamed.  He fell, motionless.

Salammbo was carried back, near swooning.  They congratulated her.  It was her doing.  The crowd roared her name.

A man rushed to the corpse, a Moloch priest's knife in his belt.  He cleft Matho's breast, tore out his heart, and offered it to the sun on a golden spatula.

The sun sank, its rays like arrows on the heart.  As the heart's beat slowed, the sun disappeared.  A single triumphant cry erupted across Carthage, shaking the buildings.  Carthage convulsed in joyous relief.

Narr' Havas, drunk with pride, put his arm around Salammbo, drank to Carthage's genius.  Salammbo rose to drink, then fell, pale, stiff, her hair loose.

Hamilcar's daughter died for touching Tanith's mantle.
