# üìñ Audiobook Generator with Intelligent Q&A

This project is a **Streamlit-based web application** that converts text documents (PDF, DOCX, TXT) into **audiobooks** and allows users to **ask questions** about the uploaded content using **semantic search powered by Sentence Transformers**.

It can also display **citations** showing where the answer was found in the document.

## üöÄ Features

‚úÖ **Audiobook Conversion** ‚Äì Converts uploaded files into clear speech using `pyttsx3`.
‚úÖ **Multi-format Support** ‚Äì Works with `.pdf`, `.docx`, and `.txt` files.
‚úÖ **Smart Q&A System** ‚Äì Uses semantic similarity (Sentence-BERT) to retrieve answers from file content.
‚úÖ **Citations** ‚Äì Displays relevant text chunks as sources for the answer.
‚úÖ **User-Friendly Interface** ‚Äì Clean Streamlit layout with progress spinners and download options.

## üß† How It Works

1. **File Upload:**
   You upload a PDF, DOCX, or TXT file. The app extracts the full text.

2. **Text-to-Speech:**
   The extracted text is processed using `pyttsx3` to generate a downloadable `.wav` audiobook file.

3. **Chunking and Embedding:**
   The document text is split into overlapping chunks for better semantic understanding, and embeddings are generated using `SentenceTransformer (all-MiniLM-L6-v2)`.

4. **Question Answering:**
   When you enter a query, the app computes cosine similarity between your question and all chunks to find the most relevant ones.

5. **Citations:**
   It displays the top 5 matching text chunks (citations) showing where the answer came from.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run the App

Once everything is installed, launch the Streamlit app:

```bash
streamlit run ui.py
```

Then open the provided local URL (usually `http://localhost:8501`) in your browser.

## üß© How to Use

1. Click **‚ÄúüìÇ Upload your file‚Äù** and choose a `.pdf`, `.docx`, or `.txt` file.
2. Wait for the text extraction confirmation ‚úÖ.
3. The app automatically generates an audiobook you can **play** or **download**.
4. In the **Q&A section**, type a question like:

   * ‚ÄúWhen was the company founded?‚Äù
   * ‚ÄúExplain the main idea of this report.‚Äù
   * ‚ÄúWhat are the key challenges mentioned?‚Äù
5. The app shows:

   * The **most relevant answer**
   * A list of **citations (source snippets)** where the answer came from

## üìå Example Output

**Question:**

> When was Cristiano Ronaldo born?

**Answer:**

> Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro was born on February 5, 1985, on the small island of Madeira, Portugal.

**Citations:**

* Chunk 2: "...Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro was born on February 5, 1985, on the small island of Madeira, Portugal..."
* Chunk 1: "Ronaldo grew up in a humble family..."

## üßë‚Äçüíª Developer Guide

### Modify Q&A Logic

You can adjust retrieval sensitivity in `retrieval.py`:

```python
retrieve_answer(query, chunks, model, top_k=5, similarity_threshold=0.4)
```

* `top_k`: Number of chunks returned as citations
* `similarity_threshold`: Minimum cosine similarity for filtering results

### Change TTS Engine Voice

In `ui.py`, modify `pyttsx3` voice parameters:

```python
engine = pyttsx3.init()
voices = engine.getProperty('voices')
engine.setProperty('voice', voices[1].id)  # Choose a different voice
```
