### AudioBook Generator 

AudioBook Generator is a web application that allows users to upload one or more text 
documents (PDF, DOCX, TXT) and automatically converts them into high-quality 
audiobooks. The application leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to rewrite extracted 
text in an engaging, listener-friendly “audiobook style” before using open-source Text-to
Speech (TTS) technology to produce downloadable audio files. This project enhances 
accessibility, productivity, and the enjoyment of written content.
