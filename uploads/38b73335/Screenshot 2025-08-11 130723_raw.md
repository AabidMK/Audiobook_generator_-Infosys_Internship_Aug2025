Develop Logging Middleware
The
'Logging
Middleware'
critical
component
for
building
robust
and
observable
applications_
While error logging is essential, we expect you to implement logging that captures
the entire lifecycle of significant events within your application
from successful operations to
warnings, informational messages, and debugging details. Think of logs as the narrative of your
application's
execution!
These
logs
are
crucial
for
understanding   application
behavior
performance, and for effective debugging
Note: While you have flexibility in choosing your backend languagelframework; the Logging
Middleware must be a reusable package
If attempting the Full Stack track, both this middleware
and your
backend application
must
be developed in TypeScriptlJavaScript to
enable the
logging package's consumption by the Frontend:
Write
a reusable function that makes an API call to the Test Server each time the function
called that matches the below structure:
Log( stack,level,package,message)
Integrate this
reusable Log function strategically throughout your codebase:
Each Log call
should provide specific and descriptive context about what's happening:
Instead of generic
messages_
aim for logs that clearly communicate the state, actions, and any relevant data at that
in the code_
point
