This is an undertaking by the parents. I confirm that my ward, Varanasi Sathwika, student ID 22WU0101103, is registered for the B.Tech CSE program, academic year 2022-2026.

As her father, I request permission for my daughter, Varanasi Sathwika, a B.Tech CSE student, to leave campus. She will depart on July 11th, 2025, at 6:00 PM for holidays. She is expected to return on July 13th, 2025, by 8:00 PM.

Please note, outings and leave are permitted only during university-declared holidays, such as festivals, national holidays, and weekends.

I, as her parent, confirm my full responsibility for my ward during this outing. University officials have informed me of all relevant details.

I insist that my ward must not deviate from campus policy and will meticulously adhere to all rules and regulations.

This undertaking is dated July 9th, 2025.
